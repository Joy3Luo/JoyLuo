Welcome to my little world.  I am glad that you find me here (≥∇≤)Y

I received my Master's degree in Machine Learning and I have my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Maryland.


Hope you will find something interesting here, I bet you will ^ - ^

I always enjoy learning more, so I keep taking online courses. I have earned those certificates:
