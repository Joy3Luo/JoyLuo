### Lesson 1 (Hello Python)

This course covers the key Python skills youâ€™ll need so you can start using Python for data science.

***Hello, Python!***
Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python, so we'll make our first Python program a homage to their skit about Spam.

```python
spam_amount = 0
print(spam_amount)

# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4

if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)

---------------------------------
OUTPUT:
0
But I don't want ANY spam!
Spam Spam Spam Spam
```

There's a lot to unpack here! This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what Python code looks like and how it works. Let's review the code from top to bottom.

```python
spam_amount = 0
```
**Variable assignment**: Here we create a variable called spam_amount and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator.

> **Aside**: If you've programmed in certain other languages (like Java or C++), you might be noticing some things Python doesn't require us to do here:
>> * we don't need to "declare" spam_amount before assigning to it
>> * we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam_amount is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam_amount to refer to a different sort of thing like a string or a boolean.

```python
print(spam_amount)
```
OUTPUT:

0
