**How does the challenge work?**

**Overview**

In the first 2 weeks, you’ll receive hands-on assignments delivered to your inbox. The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data. You'll start by learning how to code in Python and quickly learn how to build your first machine learning model.

After tackling these core concepts, you’ll be invited to a super fun, beginner-friendly Kaggle machine learning competition to test your knowledge. Through practice, you’ll explore the best ways to use Kaggle as a learning resource and connect with other data scientists.

On top of all of this, you’ll have the opportunity to attend elective workshops and seminars hosted by data scientists from Google's Developer Experts Program. The challenge kicks off on August 2nd and only requires a Kaggle account.

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Hello Python </font>

This course covers the key Python skills you’ll need so you can start using Python for data science.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Hello, Python! </font>

Python was named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python, so we'll make our first Python program a homage to their skit about Spam.

```python
spam_amount = 0
print(spam_amount)

# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4

if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)

------------------
OUTPUT:
0
But I don't want ANY spam!
Spam Spam Spam Spam
```

There's a lot to unpack here! This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what Python code looks like and how it works. Let's review the code from top to bottom.

```python
spam_amount = 0
```
**Variable assignment**: Here we create a variable called spam_amount and assign it the value of 0 using =, which is called the assignment operator.

> **Aside**: If you've programmed in certain other languages (like Java or C++), you might be noticing some things Python doesn't require us to do here:
>> * we don't need to "declare" spam_amount before assigning to it
>> * we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam_amount is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam_amount to refer to a different sort of thing like a string or a boolean.

```python
print(spam_amount)

------------------
OUTPUT:
0
```
**Function calls**:. print is a Python function that displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting parentheses after their name, and putting the inputs (or arguments) to the function in those parentheses.

```python
# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4
```
The first line above is a **comment**. In Python, comments begin with the # symbol.

Next we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the = assignment operator.

In this case, the value we're assigning to spam_amount involves some simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of the = (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-hand-side.

```python
if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam Spam Spam"
print(viking_song)

------------------
OUTPUT:
But I don't want ANY spam!
Spam Spam Spam
```

We won't talk much about "conditionals" until later, but, even if you've never coded before, you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity.

Note how we indicated which code belongs to the ```if```. ```"But I don't want ANY spam!"``` is only supposed to be printed if ```spam_amount``` is positive. But the later code (like ```print(viking_song)```) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?

The colon (```:```) at the end of the if line indicates that a new code block is starting. Subsequent lines which are indented are part of that code block.

>**Aside**: If you've coded before, you might know that some other languages use ```{```curly braces```}``` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace can be surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks.

The later lines dealing with ```viking_song``` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the ```if```'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions and using loops.

This code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:

```python
"But I don't want ANY spam!"
```

Strings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string contains a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)

```python
viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)

------------------
OUTPUT:
Spam Spam Spam Spam
```

The ```*``` operator can be used to multiply two numbers (```3 * 3``` evaluates to 9), but we can also multiply a string by a number, to get a version that's been repeated that many times. Python offers a number of cheeky little time-saving tricks like this where operators like ```*``` and ```+``` have a different meaning depending on what kind of thing they're applied to. (The technical term for this is operator overloading.)

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Numbers and arithmetic in Python </font>

We've already seen an example of a variable containing a number above:

```python
spam_amount = 0
```
"Number" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that ```spam_amount``` is:


```python
type(spam_amount)

------------------
OUTPUT:
int
```
It's an ```int``` - short for integer. There's another sort of number we commonly encounter in Python:

```python
type(19.95)

------------------
OUTPUT:
float
```
A ```float``` is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things like weights or proportions.

type() is the second built-in function we've seen (after ```print()```), and it's another good one to remember. It's very useful to be able to ask Python "what kind of thing is this?".


A natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We've seen the ```+``` operator for addition, and the ```*``` operator for multiplication. Python also has us covered for the rest of the basic buttons on your calculator:

```python
Operator	Name		Description
a + b		Addition	Sum of a and b
a - b		Subtraction	Difference of a and b
a * b		Multiplication	Product of a and b
a / b		True division	Quotient of a and b
a // b		Floor division	Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts
a % b		Modulus	Integer remainder after division of a by b
a ** b		Exponentiation	a raised to the power of b
-a		Negation	The negative of a
```

One interesting observation here is that, whereas your calculator probably just has one button for division, Python can do two kinds. "True division" is basically what your calculator does:

```python
print(5 / 2)
print(6 / 2)

------------------
OUTPUT:
2.5
3.0
```

It always gives us a ```float```.

The ```//``` operator gives us a result that's rounded down to the next integer.

```python
print(5 // 2)
print(6 // 2)

------------------
OUTPUT:
2
3
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Order of operations </font>

The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. Some remember these by a mnemonic such as PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

Python follows similar rules about which calculations to perform first. They're mostly pretty intuitive.

```python
8 - 3 + 2

------------------
OUTPUT:
7
```

```python
-3 + 4 * 2
------------------
OUTPUT:
5
```

Sometimes the default order of operations isn't what we want:

```python
hat_height_cm = 25
my_height_cm = 190
# How tall am I, in meters, when wearing my hat?
total_height_meters = hat_height_cm + my_height_cm / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters, "?")
------------------
OUTPUT:
Height in meters = 26.9 ?
```

Parentheses are useful here. You can add them to force Python to evaluate sub-expressions in whatever order you want.

```python
total_height_meters = (hat_height_cm + my_height_cm) / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Height in meters = 2.15
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Builtin functions for working with numbers </font>

min and max return the minimum and maximum of their arguments, respectively...

```python
print(min(1, 2, 3))
print(max(1, 2, 3))
------------------
OUTPUT:
1
3
```

abs returns the absolute value of an argument:

```python
print(abs(32))
print(abs(-32))
------------------
OUTPUT:
32
32
```

In addition to being the names of Python's two main numerical types, int and float can also be called as functions which convert their arguments to the corresponding type:

```python
print(float(10))
print(int(3.33))
# They can even be called on strings!
print(int('807') + 1)
------------------
OUTPUT:
10.0
3
808
```

#### <font color= 977FD7> Exercise </font>

```python
pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius = diameter/2
____

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area = pi * radius**2
```

```python
########## Setup code - don't touch this part ######################
# If you're curious, these are examples of lists. We'll talk about
# them in depth a few lessons from now. For now, just know that they're
# yet another type of Python object, like int or float.
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]
q2.store_original_ids()
######################################################################

# Your code goes here. Swap the values to which a and b refer.
# If you get stuck, you can always uncomment one or both of the lines in
# the next cell for a hint, or to peek at the solution.

c = a
a = b
b = c

Correct:

# The most straightforward solution is to use a third variable
# to temporarily store one of the old values. e.g.:
#
# tmp = a
# a = b
# b = tmp
# If you've read lots of Python code, you might have seen the
# following trick to swap two variables in one line:

# a, b = b, a
# We'll demystify this bit of Python magic later when we talk about tuples.
```


```python
# Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy
# and split it evenly among themselves. For the sake of their
# friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. For example,
# if they collectively bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30
# each and smash 1.

# Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies
# they must smash for a given haul.

# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies

to_smash = (alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Functions and Getting Help </font>

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Getting Help </font>

You saw the abs function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?

The help() function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use help(), you hold the key to understanding most other functions.

Here is an example:

```python
help(round)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on built-in function round in module builtins:

round(number, ndigits=None)
    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.

    The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.  Otherwise
    the return value has the same type as the number.  ndigits may be negative.
```
help() displays two things:

1. the header of that function round(number, ndigits=None). In this case, this tells us that round() takes an argument we can describe as number. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as ndigits.
2. A brief English description of what the function does.

**Common pitfall**: when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function.

What happens if we invoke help on a call to the function round()? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.

```python
help(round(-2.01))

Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of round(-2.01), then it provides help on the output of that expression.

(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the help output above will make more sense.)

round is a very simple function with a short docstring. help shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like print. Don't worry if the following output looks inscrutable... for now, just see if you can pick anything new out from this help.

```python
help(print)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    Optional keyword arguments:
    file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
    sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
    end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
    flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
```

If you were looking for it, you might learn that print can take an argument called sep, and that this describes what we put between all the other arguments when we print them.

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Defining functions </font>

Builtin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.

```python
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
```

This creates a function called ```least_difference```, which takes three arguments, ```a```, ```b```, and ```c```.

Functions start with a header introduced by the ```def``` keyword. The indented block of code following the ```:``` is run when the function is called.

return is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a ```return``` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.

Is it clear what ```least_difference()``` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:


```python
print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7), # Python allows trailing commas in argument lists. How nice is that?
    )
------------------
OUTPUT:
9 0 1
```

Or maybe the ```help()``` function can tell us something about it.

```python
help(least_difference)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on function least_difference in module __main__:

least_difference(a, b, c)
```

Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.

**Docstrings**

```python
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.

    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
```

The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call help() on a function, it shows the docstring.

```python
help(least_difference)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Help on function least_difference in module __main__:

least_difference(a, b, c)
    Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.

    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4

```

>**Aside**: The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The >>> is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see this docstring for the numpy function np.eye.

Good programmers use docstrings unless they expect to throw away the code soon after it's used (which is rare). So, you should start writing docstrings, too!


####<font color= 6FBCE1> Functions that don't return </font>

What would happen if we didn't include the return keyword in our function?

```python
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    min(diff1, diff2, diff3)

print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7),
    )
------------------
OUTPUT:
None None None
```

Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value None. (This is similar to the concept of "null" in other languages.)

Without a return statement, least_difference is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: print() and help() don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.

```python
mystery = print()
print(mystery)
------------------
OUTPUT:
None
```

**Default arguments**

When we called help(print), we saw that the print function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for sep to put some special string in between our printed arguments:

```python
print(1, 2, 3, sep=' < ')
------------------
OUTPUT:
1 < 2 < 3
```

But if we don't specify a value, sep is treated as having a default value of ```' '``` (a single space).

```python
print(1, 2, 3)
------------------
OUTPUT:
1 2 3
```

Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:

```python
def greet(who="Colin"):
    print("Hello,", who)

greet()
greet(who="Kaggle")
# (In this case, we don't need to specify the name of the argument, because it's unambiguous.)
greet("world")
------------------
OUTPUT:
Hello, Colin
Hello, Kaggle
Hello, world
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Functions Applied to Functions </font>

Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first. You can supply functions as arguments to other functions. Some example may make this clearer:

```python
def mult_by_five(x):
    return 5 * x

def call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on arg"""
    return fn(arg)

def squared_call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on the result of calling fn on arg"""
    return fn(fn(arg))

print(
    call(mult_by_five, 1),
    squared_call(mult_by_five, 1),
    sep='\n', # '\n' is the newline character - it starts a new line
    )
------------------
OUTPUT:
5
25
```

Functions that operate on other functions are called "higher-order functions." You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher-order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call.

Here's an interesting example using the ```max``` function.

By default, ```max``` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional ```key``` argument, it returns the argument ```x``` that maximizes ```key(x)``` (aka the 'argmax').

```python
def mod_5(x):
    """Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5"""
    return x % 5

print(
    'Which number is biggest?',
    max(100, 51, 14),
    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',
    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),
    sep='\n',
)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Which number is biggest?
100
Which number is the biggest modulo 5?
14
```

```


```python
# In the previous exercise, the candy-sharing friends Alice, Bob and

    return total_candies % num_friends
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Booleans and Conditionals </font>

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Booleans </font>

Python has a type of variable called bool. It has two possible values: True and False.

```python
x = True
print(x)
print(type(x))
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
<class 'bool'>
```

Rather than putting True or False directly in our code, we usually get boolean values from boolean operators. These are operators that answer yes/no questions. We'll go through some of these operators below.

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Comparison Operations </font>

```python
Operation     	Description		
a == b	        a equal to b
a != b	        a not equal to b
a < b	        a less than b
a > b	        a greater than b
a <= b	        a less than or equal to b
a >= b	        a greater than or equal to b
```

```python
def can_run_for_president(age):
    """Can someone of the given age run for president in the US?"""
    # The US Constitution says you must be at least 35 years old
    return age >= 35

print("Can a 19-year-old run for president?", can_run_for_president(19))
print("Can a 45-year-old run for president?", can_run_for_president(45))
------------------
OUTPUT:
Can a 19-year-old run for president? False
Can a 45-year-old run for president? True
```

Comparisons frequently work like you'd hope

```python
3.0 == 3
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

But sometimes they can be tricky

```python
'3' == 3
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
```

Comparison operators can be combined with the arithmetic operators we've already seen to express a virtually limitless range of mathematical tests. For example, we can check if a number is odd by checking that the modulus with 2 returns 1:

```python
def is_odd(n):
    return (n % 2) == 1

print("Is 100 odd?", is_odd(100))
print("Is -1 odd?", is_odd(-1))
------------------
OUTPUT:
Is 100 odd? False
Is -1 odd? True
```

Remember to use == instead of = when making comparisons. If you write n == 2 you are asking about the value of n. When you write n = 2 you are changing the value of n.

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Combining Boolean Values </font>

You can combine boolean values using the standard concepts of "and", "or", and "not". In fact, the words to do this are: and, or, and not.

With these, we can make our can_run_for_president function more accurate.

```python
def can_run_for_president(age, is_natural_born_citizen):
    """Can someone of the given age and citizenship status run for president in the US?"""
    # The US Constitution says you must be a natural born citizen *and* at least 35 years old
    return is_natural_born_citizen and (age >= 35)

print(can_run_for_president(19, True))
print(can_run_for_president(55, False))
print(can_run_for_president(55, True))
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
False
True
```

Quick, can you guess the value of this expression?

```python
True or True and False
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

To answer this, you'd need to figure out the order of operations.

For example, and is evaluated before or. That's why the first expression above is True. If we evaluated it from left to right, we would have calculated True or True first (which is True), and then taken the and of that result with False, giving a final value of False.

consider the following expression:

```python
prepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or rain_level < 5 and have_hood or not rain_level > 0 and is_workday
```

I'm trying to say that I'm safe from today's weather....

* if I have an umbrella...
* or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...
* otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining and it's a workday

But not only is my Python code hard to read, it has a bug. We can address both problems by adding some parentheses:

```python
prepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or (rain_level < 5 and have_hood) or not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday)
```

You can add even more parentheses if you think it helps readability:

```python
prepared_for_weather = have_umbrella or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood) or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))
```

We can also split it over multiple lines to emphasize the 3-part structure described above:

```python
prepared_for_weather = (
    have_umbrella
    or ((rain_level < 5) and have_hood)
    or (not (rain_level > 0 and is_workday))
)
```

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Conditionals </font>

Booleans are most useful when combined with conditional statements, using the keywords if, elif, and else.

Conditional statements, often referred to as if-then statements, let you control what pieces of code are run based on the value of some Boolean condition. Here's an example:

```python
def inspect(x):
    if x == 0:
        print(x, "is zero")
    elif x > 0:
        print(x, "is positive")
    elif x < 0:
        print(x, "is negative")
    else:
        print(x, "is unlike anything I've ever seen...")

inspect(0)
inspect(-15)
------------------
OUTPUT:
0 is zero
-15 is negative
```

The if and else keywords are often used in other languages; its more unique keyword is elif, a contraction of "else if". In these conditional clauses, elif and else blocks are optional; additionally, you can include as many elif statements as you would like.

Note especially the use of colons (:) and whitespace to denote separate blocks of code. This is similar to what happens when we define a function - the function header ends with :, and the following line is indented with 4 spaces. All subsequent indented lines belong to the body of the function, until we encounter an unindented line, ending the function definition.

```python
def f(x):
    if x > 0:
        print("Only printed when x is positive; x =", x)
        print("Also only printed when x is positive; x =", x)
    print("Always printed, regardless of x's value; x =", x)

f(1)
f(0)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Only printed when x is positive; x = 1
Also only printed when x is positive; x = 1
Always printed, regardless of x's value; x = 1
Always printed, regardless of x's value; x = 0
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Boolean conversion </font>

We've seen int(), which turns things into ints, and float(), which turns things into floats, so you might not be surprised to hear that Python has a bool() function which turns things into bools.

```python
print(bool(1)) # all numbers are treated as true, except 0
print(bool(0))
print(bool("asf")) # all strings are treated as true, except the empty string ""
print(bool(""))
# Generally empty sequences (strings, lists, and other types we've yet to see like lists and tuples)
# are "falsey" and the rest are "truthy"
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
False
True
False
```

We can use non-boolean objects in if conditions and other places where a boolean would be expected. Python will implicitly treat them as their corresponding boolean value:

```python
if 0:
    print(0)
elif "spam":
    print("spam")
------------------
OUTPUT:
spam
```

------------------

# What happens if we call it with total_candies = 1?

to_smash(1)

OUTPUT:

# the singular "candy" instead of the plural "candies")

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Lists </font>

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Lists </font>

Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values. Here is an example of how to create them:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

We can put other types of things in lists:

```python
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```
We can even make a list of lists:

```python
hands = [
    ['J', 'Q', 'K'],
    ['2', '2', '2'],
    ['6', 'A', 'K'], # (Comma after the last element is optional)
]
# (I could also have written this on one line, but it can get hard to read)
hands = [['J', 'Q', 'K'], ['2', '2', '2'], ['6', 'A', 'K']]
```

A list can contain a mix of different types of variables:

```python
my_favourite_things = [32, 'raindrops on roses', help]
# (Yes, Python's help function is *definitely* one of my favourite things)
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Indexing </font>

You can access individual list elements with square brackets.

Which planet is closest to the sun? Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has index 0.

```python
planets[0]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Mercury'
```

What's the next closest planet?

```python
planets[1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Venus'
```

Which planet is furthest from the sun?

Elements at the end of the list can be accessed with negative numbers, starting from -1:

```python
planets[-1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Neptune'
```

```python
planets[-2]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Uranus'
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Slicing </font>

What are the first three planets? We can answer this question using slicing:

```python
planets[0:3]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
```

planets[0:3] is our way of asking for the elements of planets starting from index 0 and continuing up to but not including index 3.

The starting and ending indices are both optional. If I leave out the start index, it's assumed to be 0. So I could rewrite the expression above as:

```python
planets[:3]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
```

If I leave out the end index, it's assumed to be the length of the list.

```python
planets[3:]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```

i.e. the expression above means "give me all the planets from index 3 onward".

We can also use negative indices when slicing:

```python
# All the planets except the first and last
planets[1:-1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus']
```

```python
# The last 3 planets
planets[-3:]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Changing lists </font>

Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

For example, let's say we want to rename Mars:

```python
planets[3] = 'Malacandra'
planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury',
 'Venus',
 'Earth',
 'Malacandra',
 'Jupiter',
 'Saturn',
 'Uranus',
 'Neptune']
```

Hm, that's quite a mouthful. Let's compensate by shortening the names of the first 3 planets.

```python
planets[:3] = ['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur']
print(planets)
# That was silly. Let's give them back their old names
planets[:4] = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars',]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur', 'Malacandra', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> List functions </font>

Python has several useful functions for working with lists.

len gives the length of a list:

```python
# How many planets are there?
len(planets)
------------------
OUTPUT:
8
```

sorted returns a sorted version of a list:

```python
# The planets sorted in alphabetical order
sorted(planets)
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Mars', 'Mercury', 'Neptune', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Venus']
```

sum does what you might expect:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
sum(primes)
------------------
OUTPUT:
17
```

We've previously used the min and max to get the minimum or maximum of several arguments. But we can also pass in a single list argument.

```python
max(primes)
------------------
OUTPUT:
7
```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Interlude: objects </font>

I've used the term 'object' a lot so far - you may have even read that everything in Python is an object. What does that mean?

In short, objects carry some things around with them. You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.

For example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called imag representing their imaginary part. (You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)

```python
x = 12
# x is a real number, so its imaginary part is 0.
print(x.imag)
# Here's how to make a complex number, in case you've ever been curious:
c = 12 + 3j
print(c.imag)
------------------
OUTPUT:
0
3.0
```

The things an object carries around can also include functions. A function attached to an object is called a method. (Non-function things attached to an object, such as imag, are called attributes).

For example, numbers have a method called bit_length. Again, we access it using dot syntax:

```python
x.bit_length
------------------
OUTPUT:
<function int.bit_length()>
```

To actually call it, we add parentheses:

```python
x.bit_length()
------------------
OUTPUT:
4
```

In the same way that we can pass functions to the help function (e.g. help(max)), we can also pass in methods:

```python
help(x.bit_length)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on built-in function bit_length:

bit_length() method of builtins.int instance
    Number of bits necessary to represent self in binary.

    >>> bin(37)
    '0b100101'
    >>> (37).bit_length()
    6
```

The examples above were utterly obscure. None of the types of objects we've looked at so far (numbers, functions, booleans) have attributes or methods you're likely ever to use.

But it turns out that lists have several methods which you'll use all the time.

####<font color= 6FBCE1> List methods </font>

list.append modifies a list by adding an item to the end:

```python
# Pluto is a planet darn it!
planets.append('Pluto')
```

Why does the cell above have no output? Let's check the documentation by calling help(planets.append).

> **Aside**: append is a method carried around by all objects of type list, not just planets, so we also could have called help(list.append). However, if we try to call help(append), Python will complain that no variable exists called "append". The "append" name only exists within lists - it doesn't exist as a standalone name like builtin functions such as max or len.

```python
help(planets.append)
------------------
OUTPUT:

Help on built-in function append:

append(object, /) method of builtins.list instance
    Append object to the end of the list.
```

The -> None part is telling us that list.append doesn't return anything. But if we check the value of planets, we can see that the method call modified the value of planets:

```python
planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury',
 'Venus',
 'Earth',
 'Mars',
 'Jupiter',
 'Saturn',
 'Uranus',
 'Neptune',
 'Pluto']
```

list.pop removes and returns the last element of a list:

```python
planets.pop()
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Pluto'
```

```python
planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']

```

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Searching lists </font>

Where does Earth fall in the order of planets? We can get its index using the list.index method.

```python
planets.index('Earth')
------------------
OUTPUT:
2
```

It comes third (i.e. at index 2 - 0 indexing!).

At what index does Pluto occur?

```python
planets.index('Pluto')
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-30-3a8584cba91a> in <module>
----> 1 planets.index('Pluto')

ValueError: 'Pluto' is not in list
```

Oh, that's right...

To avoid unpleasant surprises like this, we can use the in operator to determine whether a list contains a particular value:

```python
# Is Earth a planet?
"Earth" in planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

```python
# Is Calbefraques a planet?
"Calbefraques" in planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
```

There are a few more interesting list methods we haven't covered. If you want to learn about all the methods and attributes attached to a particular object, we can call help() on the object itself. For example, help(planets) will tell us about all the list methods:

```python
help(planets)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Help on list object:

class list(object)
 |  list(iterable=(), /)
 |  
 |  Built-in mutable sequence.
 |  
 |  If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
 |  The argument must be an iterable if specified.

```

 Lists have lots of methods with weird-looking names like \_\_eq\_\_ and \_\_iadd\_\_. Don't worry too much about these for now. (You'll probably never call such methods directly. But they get called behind the scenes when we use syntax like indexing or comparison operators.) The most interesting methods are toward the bottom of the list (append, clear, copy, etc.).

####<font color= 6FBCE1> Tuples </font>

Tuples are almost exactly the same as lists. They differ in just two ways.

1: The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets


```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
```

```python
t = 1, 2, 3 # equivalent to above
t
------------------
OUTPUT:
(1, 2, 3)
```

2: They cannot be modified (they are immutable).

```python
t[0] = 100
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-36-e6cf7836e708> in <module>
----> 1 t[0] = 100

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

Tuples are often used for functions that have multiple return values.

For example, the as_integer_ratio() method of float objects returns a numerator and a denominator in the form of a tuple:

```python
x = 0.125
x.as_integer_ratio()
------------------
OUTPUT:
(1, 8)
```

These multiple return values can be individually assigned as follows:

```python
numerator, denominator = x.as_integer_ratio()
print(numerator / denominator)
------------------
OUTPUT:
0.125
```

Finally we have some insight into the classic Stupid Python Trick™ for swapping two variables!

```python
a = 1
b = 0
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)
------------------
OUTPUT:
0 1
```

    name was fashionably late.
    """
    return arrivals.index(name) >= len(arrivals)/2 and arrivals.index(name) != len(arrivals) - 1

    pass
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Loops and List Comprehensions </font>

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Loops </font>

Loops are a way to repeatedly execute some code. Here's an example:

```python
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
for planet in planets:
    print(planet, end=' ') # print all on same line
------------------
OUTPUT:
Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune
```

The for loop specifies
* the variable name to use (in this case, planet)
* the set of values to loop over (in this case, planets)

You use the word "in" to link them together.

The object to the right of the "in" can be any object that supports iteration. Basically, if it can be thought of as a group of things, you can probably loop over it. In addition to lists, we can iterate over the elements of a tuple:

```python
multiplicands = (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5)
product = 1
for mult in multiplicands:
    product = product * mult
product
------------------
OUTPUT:
360
```

You can even loop through each character in a string:

```python
s = 'steganograpHy is the practicE of conceaLing a file, message, image, or video within another fiLe, message, image, Or video.'
msg = ''
# print all the uppercase letters in s, one at a time
for char in s:
    if char.isupper():
        print(char, end='')   
------------------
OUTPUT:
HELLO
```


**range()**

range() is a function that returns a sequence of numbers. It turns out to be very useful for writing loops.

For example, if we want to repeat some action 5 times:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Doing important work. i =", i)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Doing important work. i = 0
Doing important work. i = 1
Doing important work. i = 2
Doing important work. i = 3
Doing important work. i = 4
```

while loops

The other type of loop in Python is a while loop, which iterates until some condition is met:

```python
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i, end=' ')
    i += 1 # increase the value of i by 1
------------------
OUTPUT:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

The argument of the while loop is evaluated as a boolean statement, and the loop is executed until the statement evaluates to False.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> List comprehensions </font>

List comprehensions are one of Python's most beloved and unique features. The easiest way to understand them is probably to just look at a few examples:

```python
squares = [n**2 for n in range(10)]
squares
------------------
OUTPUT:
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

Here's how we would do the same thing without a list comprehension:

```python
squares = []
for n in range(10):
    squares.append(n**2)
squares
------------------
OUTPUT:
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

We can also add an if condition:

```python
short_planets = [planet for planet in planets if len(planet) < 6]
short_planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars']
```

(If you're familiar with SQL, you might think of this as being like a "WHERE" clause)

Here's an example of filtering with an if condition and applying some transformation to the loop variable:

```python
# str.upper() returns an all-caps version of a string
loud_short_planets = [planet.upper() + '!' for planet in planets if len(planet) < 6]
loud_short_planets
------------------
OUTPUT:
['VENUS!', 'EARTH!', 'MARS!']
```

People usually write these on a single line, but you might find the structure clearer when it's split up over 3 lines:

```python
[
    planet.upper() + '!'
    for planet in planets
    if len(planet) < 6
]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['VENUS!', 'EARTH!', 'MARS!']
```

(Continuing the SQL analogy, you could think of these three lines as SELECT, FROM, and WHERE)

The expression on the left doesn't technically have to involve the loop variable (though it'd be pretty unusual for it not to). What do you think the expression below will evaluate to? Press the 'output' button to check.

```python
[32 for planet in planets]
------------------
OUTPUT:
[32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32]
```

List comprehensions combined with functions like min, max, and sum can lead to impressive one-line solutions for problems that would otherwise require several lines of code.

For example, compare the following two cells of code that do the same thing.

```python
def count_negatives(nums):
    """Return the number of negative numbers in the given list.

    >>> count_negatives([5, -1, -2, 0, 3])
    2
    """
    n_negative = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num < 0:
            n_negative = n_negative + 1
    return n_negative
```

Here's a solution using a list comprehension:

```python
def count_negatives(nums):
    return len([num for num in nums if num < 0])
```

Much better, right?

Well if all we care about is minimizing the length of our code, this third solution is better still!

```python
def count_negatives(nums):
    # Reminder: in the "booleans and conditionals" exercises, we learned about a quirk of
    # Python where it calculates something like True + True + False + True to be equal to 3.
    return sum([num < 0 for num in nums])
```

Which of these solutions is the "best" is entirely subjective. Solving a problem with less code is always nice, but it's worth keeping in mind the following lines from The Zen of Python:

Readability counts.
Explicit is better than implicit.

So, use these tools to make compact readable programs. But when you have to choose, favor code that is easy for others to understand.

#### <font color= 977FD7> Exercise </font>

```python
from learntools.core import binder; binder.bind(globals())
from learntools.python.ex5 import *
print('Setup complete.')
------------------
OUTPUT:
Setup complete.
```

1. Have you ever felt debugging involved a bit of luck? The following program has a bug. Try to identify the bug and fix it.

```python
def has_lucky_number(nums):
    """Return whether the given list of numbers is lucky. A lucky list contains
    at least one number divisible by 7.
    """
    for num in nums:
        if num % 7 == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Solution: Return causes a function to exit immediately

```python
def has_lucky_number(nums):
    for num in nums:
        if num % 7 == 0:
            return True
    # We've exhausted the list without finding a lucky number
    return False
```

Here's a one-line version using a list comprehension with Python's any function

```python
def has_lucky_number(nums):
    return any([num % 7 == 0 for num in nums])
```

2. Look at the Python expression below. What do you think we'll get when we run it? When you've made your prediction, uncomment the code and run the cell to see if you were right.

```python
[1, 2, 3, 4] > 2
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[9], line 1
----> 1 [1, 2, 3, 4] > 2

TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'
```

R and Python have some libraries (like numpy and pandas) compare each element of the list to 2 (i.e. do an 'element-wise' comparison) and give us a list of booleans like [False, False, True, True].

Implement a function that reproduces this behaviour, returning a list of booleans corresponding to whether the corresponding element is greater than n.

```python
def elementwise_greater_than(L, thresh):
    """Return a list with the same length as L, where the value at index i is
    True if L[i] is greater than thresh, and False otherwise.

    >>> elementwise_greater_than([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
    [False, False, True, True]
    """
    pass

# Check your answer
q2.check()
```

Solution:

```python
def elementwise_greater_than(L, thresh):
    res = []
    for ele in L:
        res.append(ele > thresh)
    return res
And here's the list comprehension version:

def elementwise_greater_than(L, thresh):
    return [ele > thresh for ele in L]
```

And here's the list comprehension version:

```python
def elementwise_greater_than(L, thresh):
    return [ele > thresh for ele in L]
```

3. Complete the body of the function below according to its docstring.

```python
def menu_is_boring(meals):
    """Given a list of meals served over some period of time, return True if the
    same meal has ever been served two days in a row, and False otherwise.
    """
    pass

# Check your answer
q3.check()
```

Solution:

```python
def menu_is_boring(meals):
    # Iterate over all indices of the list, except the last one
    for i in range(len(meals)-1):
        if meals[i] == meals[i+1]:
            return True
    return False
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Strings and Dictionaries </font>

This lesson will cover two essential Python types: strings and dictionaries.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Strings </font>

One place where the Python language really shines is in the manipulation of strings. This section will cover some of Python's built-in string methods and formatting operations.

Such string manipulation patterns come up often in the context of data science work.

**String syntax**

You've already seen plenty of strings in examples during the previous lessons, but just to recap, strings in Python can be defined using either single or double quotations. They are functionally equivalent.

```python
x = 'Pluto is a planet'
y = "Pluto is a planet"
x == y
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

Double quotes are convenient if your string contains a single quote character (e.g. representing an apostrophe).

Similarly, it's easy to create a string that contains double-quotes if you wrap it in single quotes:

```python
print("Pluto's a planet!")
print('My dog is named "Pluto"')
------------------
OUTPUT:
Pluto's a planet!
My dog is named "Pluto"
```

If we try to put a single quote character inside a single-quoted string, Python gets confused:

```python
'Pluto's a planet!'
------------------
OUTPUT:
File "/tmp/ipykernel_19/1561186517.py", line 1
  'Pluto's a planet!'
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

We can fix this by "escaping" the single quote with a backslash.

```python
'Pluto\'s a planet!'
------------------
OUTPUT:
"Pluto's a planet!"
```

The table below summarizes some important uses of the backslash character.

What you type...	 | What you get | example | print(example)
--- | --- | ---  | ---
\\'|	'	|'What\\'s up?'|	What's up?
\\"|	"|	"That's \\"cool\\"|"	That's "cool"
\\\ |	\\	|"Look, a mountain: /\\\\"|	Look, a mountain: /\

The last sequence, \n, represents the newline character. It causes Python to start a new line.

```python
hello = "hello\nworld"
print(hello)
------------------
OUTPUT:
hello
world
```

In addition, Python's triple quote syntax for strings lets us include newlines literally (i.e. by just hitting 'Enter' on our keyboard, rather than using the special '\n' sequence). We've already seen this in the docstrings we use to document our functions, but we can use them anywhere we want to define a string.

```python
triplequoted_hello = """hello
world"""
print(triplequoted_hello)
triplequoted_hello == hello
------------------
OUTPUT:
hello
world
True
```

The print() function automatically adds a newline character unless we specify a value for the keyword argument end other than the default value of '\n':

```python
print("hello")
print("world")
print("hello", end='')
print("pluto", end='')
------------------
OUTPUT:
hello
world
hellopluto
```

**Strings are sequences**

Strings can be thought of as sequences of characters. Almost everything we've seen that we can do to a list, we can also do to a string.

```python
# Indexing
planet = 'Pluto'
planet[0]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'P'
```

```python
# Slicing
planet[-3:]
------------------
OUTPUT:
'uto'
```

```python
# How long is this string?
len(planet)
------------------
OUTPUT:
5
```

```python
# Yes, we can even loop over them
[char+'! ' for char in planet]
------------------
OUTPUT:
['P! ', 'l! ', 'u! ', 't! ', 'o! ']
```

But a major way in which they differ from lists is that they are immutable. We can't modify them.

```python
planet[0] = 'B'
# planet.append doesn't work either
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/tmp/ipykernel_19/2683731249.py in <module>
----> 1 planet[0] = 'B'
      2 # planet.append doesn't work either

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

**String methods**

Like list, the type str has lots of very useful methods. I'll show just a few examples here.

```python
# ALL CAPS
claim = "Pluto is a planet!"
claim.upper()
------------------
OUTPUT:
'PLUTO IS A PLANET!'
```

```python
# all lowercase
claim.lower()
------------------
OUTPUT:
'pluto is a planet!'
```

```python
# Searching for the first index of a substring
claim.index('plan')
------------------
OUTPUT:
11
```

```python
claim = "Pluto is a planet!"
planet = 'Pluto'
claim.startswith(planet)
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

```python
# false because of missing exclamation mark
claim.endswith('planet')
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
```

**Going between strings and lists: .split() and .join()**

str.split() turns a string into a list of smaller strings, breaking on whitespace by default. This is super useful for taking you from one big string to a list of words.

```python
words = claim.split()
words
------------------
OUTPUT:
['Pluto', 'is', 'a', 'planet!']
```

Occasionally you'll want to split on something other than whitespace:

```python
datestr = '1956-01-31'
year, month, day = datestr.split('-')
```

str.join() takes us in the other direction, sewing a list of strings up into one long string, using the string it was called on as a separator.

```python
'/'.join([month, day, year])
------------------
OUTPUT:
'01/31/1956'
```

```python
# Yes, we can put unicode characters right in our string literals :)
' 👏 '.join([word.upper() for word in words])
------------------
OUTPUT:
'PLUTO 👏 IS 👏 A 👏 PLANET!'
```

**Building strings with .format()**

Python lets us concatenate strings with the + operator.

```python
planet + ', we miss you.'
------------------
OUTPUT:
'Pluto, we miss you.'
```

If we want to throw in any non-string objects, we have to be careful to call str() on them first

```python
position = 9
planet + ", you'll always be the " + position + "th planet to me."
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/tmp/ipykernel_19/1802981568.py in <module>
      1 position = 9
----> 2 planet + ", you'll always be the " + position + "th planet to me."

TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

```python
planet + ", you'll always be the " + str(position) + "th planet to me."
------------------
OUTPUT:
"Pluto, you'll always be the 9th planet to me."
```

This is getting hard to read and annoying to type. str.format() to the rescue.

```python
"{}, you'll always be the {}th planet to me.".format(planet, position)
------------------
OUTPUT:
"Pluto, you'll always be the 9th planet to me."
```

So much cleaner! We call .format() on a "format string", where the Python values we want to insert are represented with {} placeholders.

Notice how we didn't even have to call str() to convert position from an int. format() takes care of that for us.

If that was all that format() did, it would still be incredibly useful. But as it turns out, it can do a lot more. Here's just a taste:

```python
pluto_mass = 1.303 * 10**22
earth_mass = 5.9722 * 10**24
population = 52910390
#         2 decimal points   3 decimal points, format as percent     separate with commas
"{} weighs about {:.2} kilograms ({:.3%} of Earth's mass). It is home to {:,} Plutonians.".format(
    planet, pluto_mass, pluto_mass / earth_mass, population,
)
------------------
OUTPUT:
"Pluto weighs about 1.3e+22 kilograms (0.218% of Earth's mass). It is home to 52,910,390 Plutonians."
```

```python
# Referring to format() arguments by index, starting from 0
s = """Pluto's a {0}.
No, it's a {1}.
{0}!
{1}!""".format('planet', 'dwarf planet')
print(s)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Pluto's a planet.
No, it's a dwarf planet.
planet!
dwarf planet!
```

You could probably write a short book just on str.format, so I'll stop here, and point you to pyformat.info and the official docs for further reading.


#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Dictionaries </font>

Dictionaries are a built-in Python data structure for mapping keys to values.

```python
numbers = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}
```

In this case 'one', 'two', and 'three' are the keys, and 1, 2 and 3 are their corresponding values.

Values are accessed via square bracket syntax similar to indexing into lists and strings.

```python
numbers['one']
------------------
OUTPUT:
1
```

We can use the same syntax to add another key, value pair

```python
numbers['eleven'] = 11
numbers
------------------
OUTPUT:
{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'eleven': 11}
```

Or to change the value associated with an existing key

```python
numbers['one'] = 'Pluto'
numbers
------------------
OUTPUT:
{'one': 'Pluto', 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'eleven': 11}
```

Python has dictionary comprehensions with a syntax similar to the list comprehensions we saw in the previous tutorial.

```python
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
planet_to_initial = {planet: planet[0] for planet in planets}
planet_to_initial
------------------
OUTPUT:
{'Mercury': 'M',
 'Venus': 'V',
 'Earth': 'E',
 'Mars': 'M',
 'Jupiter': 'J',
 'Saturn': 'S',
 'Uranus': 'U',
 'Neptune': 'N'}
```

The in operator tells us whether something is a key in the dictionary

```python
'Saturn' in planet_to_initial
------------------
OUTPUT:
True
```

```python
'Betelgeuse' in planet_to_initial
------------------
OUTPUT:
False
```

A for loop over a dictionary will loop over its keys

```python
for k in numbers:
    print("{} = {}".format(k, numbers[k]))
------------------
OUTPUT:
one = Pluto
two = 2
three = 3
eleven = 11
```

We can access a collection of all the keys or all the values with dict.keys() and dict.values(), respectively.

```python
# Get all the initials, sort them alphabetically, and put them in a space-separated string.
' '.join(sorted(planet_to_initial.values()))
------------------
OUTPUT:
'E J M M N S U V'
```

The very useful dict.items() method lets us iterate over the keys and values of a dictionary simultaneously. (In Python jargon, an item refers to a key, value pair)

```python
for planet, initial in planet_to_initial.items():
    print("{} begins with \"{}\"".format(planet.rjust(10), initial))
------------------
OUTPUT:
Mercury begins with "M"
  Venus begins with "V"
  Earth begins with "E"
   Mars begins with "M"
Jupiter begins with "J"
 Saturn begins with "S"
 Uranus begins with "U"
Neptune begins with "N"
```

1. There is a saying that "Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data, and 20% of their time complaining about cleaning data." Let's see if you can write a function to help clean US zip code data. Given a string, it should return whether or not that string represents a valid zip code. For our purposes, a valid zip code is any string consisting of exactly 5 digits.

```python
def is_valid_zip(zip_code):
    """Returns whether the input string is a valid (5 digit) zip code
    """
    pass

# Check your answer
q1.check()
```

Solution:

```python
def is_valid_zip(zip_code):
    return len(zip_code) == 5 and zip_code.isdigit()
```

2. A researcher has gathered thousands of news articles. But she wants to focus her attention on articles including a specific word. Complete the function below to help her filter her list of articles.

Your function should meet the following criteria:

* Do not include documents where the keyword string shows up only as a part of a larger word. For example, if she were looking for the keyword “closed”, you would not include the string “enclosed.”
* She does not want you to distinguish upper case from lower case letters. So the phrase “Closed the case.” would be included when the keyword is “closed”
* Do not let periods or commas affect what is matched. “It is closed.” would be included when the keyword is “closed”. But you can assume there are no other types of punctuation.

```python
def word_search(doc_list, keyword):
    """
    Takes a list of documents (each document is a string) and a keyword.
    Returns list of the index values into the original list for all documents
    containing the keyword.

    Example:
    doc_list = ["The Learn Python Challenge Casino.", "They bought a car", "Casinoville"]
    >>> word_search(doc_list, 'casino')
    >>> [0]
    """
    pass

# Check your answer
q2.check()
```

Solution:

```python
def word_search(doc_list, keyword):
    # list to hold the indices of matching documents
    indices = []
    # Iterate through the indices (i) and elements (doc) of documents
    for i, doc in enumerate(doc_list):
        # Split the string doc into a list of words (according to whitespace)
        tokens = doc.split()
        # Make a transformed list where we 'normalize' each word to facilitate matching.
        # Periods and commas are removed from the end of each word, and it's set to all lowercase.
        normalized = [token.rstrip('.,').lower() for token in tokens]
        # Is there a match? If so, update the list of matching indices.
        if keyword.lower() in normalized:
            indices.append(i)
    return indices
```

3. Now the researcher wants to supply multiple keywords to search for. Complete the function below to help her.

(You're encouraged to use the word_search function you just wrote when implementing this function. Reusing code in this way makes your programs more robust and readable - and it saves typing!)

```python
def multi_word_search(doc_list, keywords):
    """
    Takes list of documents (each document is a string) and a list of keywords.  
    Returns a dictionary where each key is a keyword, and the value is a list of indices
    (from doc_list) of the documents containing that keyword

    >>> doc_list = ["The Learn Python Challenge Casino.", "They bought a car and a casino", "Casinoville"]
    >>> keywords = ['casino', 'they']
    >>> multi_word_search(doc_list, keywords)
    {'casino': [0, 1], 'they': [1]}
    """
    pass

# Check your answer
q3.check()
```

Solution:

```python
def multi_word_search(documents, keywords):
    keyword_to_indices = {}
    for keyword in keywords:
        keyword_to_indices[keyword] = word_search(documents, keyword)
    return keyword_to_indices
```

## <font color= 977FD7> Python - Working with External Libraries </font>

In this tutorial, you will learn about imports in Python, get some tips for working with unfamiliar libraries (and the objects they return), and dig into operator overloading.

#### <font color= 6FBCE1> Imports </font>

So far we've talked about types and functions which are built-in to the language.

But one of the best things about Python (especially if you're a data scientist) is the vast number of high-quality custom libraries that have been written for it.

Some of these libraries are in the "standard library", meaning you can find them anywhere you run Python. Other libraries can be easily added, even if they aren't always shipped with Python.

Either way, we'll access this code with imports.

We'll start our example by importing math from the standard library.

```python
import math

print("It's math! It has type {}".format(type(math)))
------------------
OUTPUT:
It's math! It has type <class 'module'>
```

math is a module. A module is just a collection of variables (a namespace, if you like) defined by someone else. We can see all the names in math using the built-in function dir().

```python
print(dir(math))
------------------
OUTPUT:
['__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1', 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma', 'gcd', 'hypot', 'inf', 'isclose', 'isfinite', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p', 'log2', 'modf', 'nan', 'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'remainder', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'tau', 'trunc']
```

We can access these variables using dot syntax. Some of them refer to simple values, like math.pi:

```python
print("pi to 4 significant digits = {:.4}".format(math.pi))
------------------
OUTPUT:
pi to 4 significant digits = 3.142
```

But most of what we'll find in the module are functions, like math.log:

```python
math.log(32, 2)
------------------
OUTPUT:
5.0
```

Of course, if we don't know what math.log does, we can call help() on it:

```python
help(math.log)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Help on built-in function log in module math:

log(...)
    log(x, [base=math.e])
    Return the logarithm of x to the given base.

    If the base not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
```

**Other import syntax**

If we know we'll be using functions in math frequently we can import it under a shorter alias to save some typing (though in this case "math" is already pretty short).

```python
import math as mt
mt.pi
------------------
OUTPUT:
3.141592653589793
```

You may have seen code that does this with certain popular libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, or Matplotlib. For example, it's a common convention to import numpy as np and import pandas as pd.

The as simply renames the imported module. It's equivalent to doing something like:

```python
import math
mt = math
```

Wouldn't it be great if we could refer to all the variables in the math module by themselves? i.e. if we could just refer to pi instead of math.pi or mt.pi? Good news: we can do that.

```python
from math import *
print(pi, log(32, 2))
------------------
OUTPUT:
3.141592653589793 5.0
```

import * makes all the module's variables directly accessible to you (without any dotted prefix).

Bad news: some purists might grumble at you for doing this.

Worse: they kind of have a point.

```python
from math import *
from numpy import *
print(pi, log(32, 2))
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/tmp/ipykernel_19/3018510453.py in <module>
      1 from math import *
      2 from numpy import *
----> 3 print(pi, log(32, 2))

TypeError: return arrays must be of ArrayType
```

What has happened? It worked before!

These kinds of "star imports" can occasionally lead to weird, difficult-to-debug situations.

The problem in this case is that the math and numpy modules both have functions called log, but they have different semantics. Because we import from numpy second, its log overwrites (or "shadows") the log variable we imported from math.

A good compromise is to import only the specific things we'll need from each module:

```python
from math import log, pi
from numpy import asarray
```

**Submodules**

We've seen that modules contain variables which can refer to functions or values. Something to be aware of is that they can also have variables referring to other modules.

```python
import numpy
print("numpy.random is a", type(numpy.random))
print("it contains names such as...",
      dir(numpy.random)[-15:]
     )
------------------
OUTPUT:
numpy.random is a <class 'module'>
it contains names such as... ['seed', 'set_state', 'shuffle', 'standard_cauchy', 'standard_exponential', 'standard_gamma', 'standard_normal', 'standard_t', 'test', 'triangular', 'uniform', 'vonmises', 'wald', 'weibull', 'zipf']
```

So if we import numpy as above, then calling a function in the random "submodule" will require two dots.

```python
# Roll 10 dice
rolls = numpy.random.randint(low=1, high=6, size=10)
rolls
------------------
OUTPUT:
array([3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3])
```

**Oh the places you'll go, oh the objects you'll see**

So after 6 lessons, you're a pro with ints, floats, bools, lists, strings, and dicts (right?).

Even if that were true, it doesn't end there. As you work with various libraries for specialized tasks, you'll find that they define their own types which you'll have to learn to work with. For example, if you work with the graphing library matplotlib, you'll be coming into contact with objects it defines which represent Subplots, Figures, TickMarks, and Annotations. pandas functions will give you DataFrames and Series.

In this section, I want to share with you a quick survival guide for working with strange types.

**Three tools for understanding strange objects**

In the cell above, we saw that calling a numpy function gave us an "array". We've never seen anything like this before (not in this course anyways). But don't panic: we have three familiar builtin functions to help us here.

1: type() (what is this thing?)

```python
type(rolls)
------------------
OUTPUT:
numpy.ndarray
```

2: dir() (what can I do with it?)

```python
print(dir(rolls))
------------------
OUTPUT:
['T', '__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__array__', '__array_finalize__', '__array_function__', '__array_interface__', '__array_prepare__', '__array_priority__', '__array_struct__', '__array_ufunc__', '__array_wrap__', '__bool__', '__class__', '__complex__', '__contains__', '__copy__', '__deepcopy__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__divmod__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__float__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__iand__', '__ifloordiv__', '__ilshift__', '__imatmul__', '__imod__', '__imul__', '__index__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__ior__', '__ipow__', '__irshift__', '__isub__', '__iter__', '__itruediv__', '__ixor__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lshift__', '__lt__', '__matmul__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmatmul__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__setstate__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', '__truediv__', '__xor__', 'all', 'any', 'argmax', 'argmin', 'argpartition', 'argsort', 'astype', 'base', 'byteswap', 'choose', 'clip', 'compress', 'conj', 'conjugate', 'copy', 'ctypes', 'cumprod', 'cumsum', 'data', 'diagonal', 'dot', 'dtype', 'dump', 'dumps', 'fill', 'flags', 'flat', 'flatten', 'getfield', 'imag', 'item', 'itemset', 'itemsize', 'max', 'mean', 'min', 'nbytes', 'ndim', 'newbyteorder', 'nonzero', 'partition', 'prod', 'ptp', 'put', 'ravel', 'real', 'repeat', 'reshape', 'resize', 'round', 'searchsorted', 'setfield', 'setflags', 'shape', 'size', 'sort', 'squeeze', 'std', 'strides', 'sum', 'swapaxes', 'take', 'tobytes', 'tofile', 'tolist', 'tostring', 'trace', 'transpose', 'var', 'view']
```

```python
# If I want the average roll, the "mean" method looks promising...
rolls.mean()
------------------
OUTPUT:
3.3
```

```python
# Or maybe I just want to turn the array into a list, in which case I can use "tolist"
rolls.tolist()
------------------
OUTPUT:
[3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3]
```

3: help() (tell me more)

```python
# That "ravel" attribute sounds interesting. I'm a big classical music fan.
help(rolls.ravel)
------------------
OUTPUT:
Help on built-in function ravel:

ravel(...) method of numpy.ndarray instance
    a.ravel([order])

    Return a flattened array.

    Refer to `numpy.ravel` for full documentation.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.ravel : equivalent function

    ndarray.flat : a flat iterator on the array.
```

**Operator overloading**

What's the value of the below expression?

```python
[3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1] + 10
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/tmp/ipykernel_19/2144087748.py in <module>
----> 1 [3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 1] + 10

TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
```

What a silly question. Of course it's an error.

But what about...

```python
rolls + 10
------------------
OUTPUT:
array([13, 14, 13, 14, 15, 15, 12, 11, 13, 13])
```

We might think that Python strictly polices how pieces of its core syntax behave such as +, <, in, ==, or square brackets for indexing and slicing. But in fact, it takes a very hands-off approach. When you define a new type, you can choose how addition works for it, or what it means for an object of that type to be equal to something else.

The designers of lists decided that adding them to numbers wasn't allowed. The designers of numpy arrays went a different way (adding the number to each element of the array).

Here are a few more examples of how numpy arrays interact unexpectedly with Python operators (or at least differently from lists).

```python
# At which indices are the dice less than or equal to 3?
rolls <= 3
------------------
OUTPUT:
array([ True, False,  True, False, False, False,  True,  True,  True,
        True])
```

```python
xlist = [[1,2,3],[2,4,6],]
# Create a 2-dimensional array
x = numpy.asarray(xlist)
print("xlist = {}\nx =\n{}".format(xlist, x))
------------------
OUTPUT:
xlist = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6]]
x =
[[1 2 3]
 [2 4 6]]
```

```python
# Get the last element of the second row of our numpy array
x[1,-1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
6
```

```python
# Get the last element of the second sublist of our nested list?
xlist[1,-1]
------------------
OUTPUT:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/tmp/ipykernel_19/3020169379.py in <module>
      1 # Get the last element of the second sublist of our nested list?
----> 2 xlist[1,-1]

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple
```

numpy's ndarray type is specialized for working with multi-dimensional data, so it defines its own logic for indexing, allowing us to index by a tuple to specify the index at each dimension.

**When does 1 + 1 not equal 2?**

Things can get weirder than this. You may have heard of (or even used) tensorflow, a Python library popularly used for deep learning. It makes extensive use of operator overloading.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# Create two constants, each with value 1
a = tf.constant(1)
b = tf.constant(1)
# Add them together to get...
a + b
------------------
OUTPUT:
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=2>
```

a + b isn't 2, it is (to quote tensorflow's documentation)...

a symbolic handle to one of the outputs of an Operation. It does not hold the values of that operation's output, but instead provides a means of computing those values in a TensorFlow tf.Session.

It's important just to be aware of the fact that this sort of thing is possible and that libraries will often use operator overloading in non-obvious or magical-seeming ways.

Understanding how Python's operators work when applied to ints, strings, and lists is no guarantee that you'll be able to immediately understand what they do when applied to a tensorflow Tensor, or a numpy ndarray, or a pandas DataFrame.

Once you've had a little taste of DataFrames, for example, an expression like the one below starts to look appealingly intuitive:

```python
# Get the rows with population over 1m in South America
df[(df['population'] > 10**6) & (df['continent'] == 'South America')]
```

But why does it work? The example above features something like 5 different overloaded operators. What's each of those operations doing? It can help to know the answer when things start going wrong.

**Curious how it all works?**

Have you ever called help() or dir() on an object and wondered what the heck all those names with the double-underscores were?

```python
print(dir(list))
------------------
OUTPUT:
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']
```

This turns out to be directly related to operator overloading.

When Python programmers want to define how operators behave on their types, they do so by implementing methods with special names beginning and ending with 2 underscores such as `__lt__, __setattr__, or __contains__`. Generally, names that follow this double-underscore format have a special meaning to Python.

So, for example, the expression x in [1, 2, 3] is actually calling the list method `__contains__ `behind-the-scenes. It's equivalent to (the much uglier) [1, 2, 3].`__contains__(x)`.

If you're curious to learn more, you can check out Python's official documentation, which describes many, many more of these special "underscores" methods.

We won't be defining our own types in these lessons (if only there was time!), but I hope you'll get to experience the joys of defining your own wonderful, weird types later down the road.

## <font color= 977FD7> Intro to ML - How Models Work </font>

**Introduction**

We'll start with an overview of how machine learning models work and how they are used. This may feel basic if you've done statistical modeling or machine learning before. Don't worry, we will progress to building powerful models soon.

This course will have you build models as you go through following scenario:

Your cousin has made millions of dollars speculating on real estate. He's offered to become business partners with you because of your interest in data science. He'll supply the money, and you'll supply models that predict how much various houses are worth.

You ask your cousin how he's predicted real estate values in the past, and he says it is just intuition. But more questioning reveals that he's identified price patterns from houses he has seen in the past, and he uses those patterns to make predictions for new houses he is considering.

Machine learning works the same way. We'll start with a model called the Decision Tree. There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science.

For simplicity, we'll start with the simplest possible decision tree.

It divides houses into only two categories. The predicted price for any house under consideration is the historical average price of houses in the same category.

We use data to decide how to break the houses into two groups, and then again to determine the predicted price in each group. This step of capturing patterns from data is called fitting or training the model. The data used to fit the model is called the training data.

The details of how the model is fit (e.g. how to split up the data) is complex enough that we will save it for later. After the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to predict prices of additional homes.

**Improving the Decision Tree**

Which of the following two decision trees is more likely to result from fitting the real estate training data?

The decision tree on the left (Decision Tree 1) probably makes more sense, because it captures the reality that houses with more bedrooms tend to sell at higher prices than houses with fewer bedrooms. The biggest shortcoming of this model is that it doesn't capture most factors affecting home price, like number of bathrooms, lot size, location, etc.

You can capture more factors using a tree that has more "splits." These are called "deeper" trees. A decision tree that also considers the total size of each house's lot might look like this:

You predict the price of any house by tracing through the decision tree, always picking the path corresponding to that house's characteristics. The predicted price for the house is at the bottom of the tree. The point at the bottom where we make a prediction is called a leaf.

The splits and values at the leaves will be determined by the data, so it's time for you to check out the data you will be working with.

## <font color= 977FD7> Intro to ML - Basic Data Exploration </font>

**Using Pandas to Get Familiar With Your Data**

The first step in any machine learning project is familiarize yourself with the data. You'll use the Pandas library for this. Pandas is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data. Most people abbreviate pandas in their code as pd. We do this with the command

```python
import pandas as pd
```

The most important part of the Pandas library is the DataFrame. A DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table. This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database.

Pandas has powerful methods for most things you'll want to do with this type of data.

As an example, we'll look at data about home prices in Melbourne, Australia. In the hands-on exercises, you will apply the same processes to a new dataset, which has home prices in Iowa.

The example (Melbourne) data is at the file path ../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv.

We load and explore the data with the following commands:

```python
# save filepath to variable for easier access
melbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'
# read the data and store data in DataFrame titled melbourne_data
melbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path)
# print a summary of the data in Melbourne data
melbourne_data.describe()

**Interpreting Data Description**

The results show 8 numbers for each column in your original dataset. The first number, the count, shows how many rows have non-missing values.

Missing values arise for many reasons. For example, the size of the 2nd bedroom wouldn't be collected when surveying a 1 bedroom house. We'll come back to the topic of missing data.

The second value is the mean, which is the average. Under that, std is the standard deviation, which measures how numerically spread out the values are.

To interpret the min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value. The first (smallest) value is the min. If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values. That is the 25% value (pronounced "25th percentile"). The 50th and 75th percentiles are defined analogously, and the max is the largest number.
