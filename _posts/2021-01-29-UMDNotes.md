  ## <font color= 977FD7> Math 416 - Applied Harmonic Analysis: An Introduction to Signal Processing</font>

  #### <font color= E675A7> I am working on this right now \>w\<</font>

  #### Description
  The goal of this course is to introduce the students to the modern mathematical techniques which are applied in signal processing and which are used in a variety of areas, ranging from engineering to medicine and finance. Topics include: Applied Linear Algebra, Fourier Series, Discrete Fourier Transform, Fourier Transform, Shannon Sampling Theorem, Wavelet Bases, Multiresolution Analysis, and Discrete Wavelet Transform. Emphasis will be placed upon mathematical foundations of applicable algorithms, as well as on the ability to implement these algorithms.

## <font color= 977FD7> AMSC 460 Computational Methods</font>

#### Description
Basic computational methods for interpolation, least squares, approximation, numerical quadrature, numerical solution of nonlinear equations, systems of linear equations, and initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. Emphasis on the methods and their computational properties rather on their analytic aspects.

## <font color= 977FD7> Math 402 - Algebraic Structures</font>

#### Description
The course covers the basics of groups, rings, integral domains and fields. There will be a detailed study of several groups, and a study of the properties of integers and polynomials. Emphasis is on the origin of the mathematical ideas studied and the logical structure of the subject. (This course is not open to mathematics graduate students. Credit will only be given for one of Math 402 and 403.) The last item in the list of topics could be replaced by other topics in algebra, for example, coding theory or crystallographic groups.

## <font color= 977FD7> Math 411 - Advanced Calculus II</font>

#### Description
Covered sequences and series of numbers, continuity and differentiability of real valued functions of one variable, the Riemann integral, sequences of functions and power series. Functions of several variables including partial derivatives, multiple integrals, line and surface integrals. The implicit function theorem.......
