#### Story Behind the Design:

In college, final exam season prompts a two-week-long cram session. Everyone has their own tales of studying all night, downing dangerous levels of caffeine, and rubbing their eyes at lecture notes. But after a while, extra studying doesn't really help; you're reading the same material, but your brain is so zapped that you won't retain anything.

You thought you just need to take a short break so you start scrolling on TikTok.

3 hours passed, and you are even more tired.

Most college students are facing this problem right now. Later on, they realized they were getting distracted so easily and not using their study time efficiently,

A simple timer could help, set it for 10 minutes, and tried working solidly for those 10 minutes without doing anything else, then set it for another 10 minutes, at this time rewarding yourself for a break!

This worked â€” forcing yourself to focus before rewarding yourself with a break helped you to get more done !
