The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions. AWS has 22 Regions worldwide. An AWS Region is a physical geographical location with one or more Availability Zones. Availability Zones in turn consist of one or more data centers.

To achieve fault tolerance and stability, Regions are isolated from one another. Resources in one Region are not automatically replicated to other Regions. When you store data in a specific Region, it is not replicated outside that Region.

It is your responsibility to replicate data across Regions, if your business needs require it.

AWS Regions that were introduced before March 20, 2019 are enabledby default. Regions that were introduced after March 20, 2019—such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) and Middle East (Bahrain)—are disabledby default. You must enable these Regions before you can use them. You can use the AWS Management Console to enable or disable a Region.

Some Regions have restricted access. An Amazon AWS (China) account provides access to the Beijing and Ningxia Regions only. To learn more about AWS in China, see: https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/about-aws/china/. The isolated AWS GovCloud (US) Region is designed to allow US government agencies and customers to move sensitive workloads into the cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements.

There are a few factors that you should consider when you select the optimal Region or Regions where you store data and use AWS services.

One essential consideration is data governance and legal requirements. Local laws might require that certain information be kept within geographical boundaries. Such laws might restrict the Regions where you can offer content or services. For example, consider the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive.

All else being equal, it is generally desirable to run your applications and store your data in a Region that is as close as possible to the user and systems that will access them. This will help you reduce latency. CloudPing is one website that you can use to test latency between your location and all AWS Regions.

Finally, there is some variation in the costof running services, which can depend on which Region you choose. For example, as of this writing, running an On-Demand t3.medium size Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instance in the US East (Ohio) Region costs $0.0416 per hour, but running the same instance in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region costs $0.0544 per hour.

Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations that are known asAvailability Zones.

Each Availability Zone provides the ability to operate applications and databases that are more highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable than would be possible with a single data center. Each Availability Zone can include multiple data centers (typically three), and at full-scale, they can include hundreds of thousands of servers. They are fully isolated partitions of the AWS Global Infrastructure. Availability Zones have their own power infrastructure, andthey are physically separated by many kilometers from other Availability Zones—though all Availability Zones are within 100 km of each other.

All Availability Zones are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated fiber that provides high-throughput between Availability Zones. The network accomplishes synchronous replication between Availability Zones.

Availability Zones help build highly available applications. When an application is partitioned across Availability Zones, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as lightning, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more.

You are responsible for selecting the Availability Zones where your systems will reside. Systems can span multiple Availability Zones. AWS recommends replicating across Availability Zones for resiliency. You should design your systems to survive the temporary or prolonged failure of an Availability Zone if a disaster occurs.

The foundation for the AWS infrastructure is the data centers. Customers do not specify a data center for the deployment of resources. Instead, an Availability Zone is the most granular level of specification that a customer can make. However, a data center is the location where the actual data resides. Amazon operates state-of-the-art, highly available data centers. Although rare, failures can occur that affect the availability of instances in the same location. If you host all your instances in a single location that is affected by such a failure, none of your instances will be available.

Data centers are securely designed with several factors in mind:
- Each location is carefully evaluated to mitigate environmental risk.
- Data centers have a redundant design that anticipates and tolerates failure while maintaining service levels.
- To ensure availability, critical system components are backed upacross multiple Availability Zones.
- To ensure capacity, AWS continuously monitors service usage to deploy infrastructure to support availability commitments and requirements.
- Data center locations are not disclosedand all access to them is restricted.
- In case of failure, automated processes move data traffic away from the affected area.

AWS uses custom network equipment sourced from multiple original device manufacturers (ODMs). ODMs design and manufacture products based on specifications from a second company. The second company then rebrands the products for sale.

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network(CDN) used to distribute content to end users to reduce latency. Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service. Requests going to either one of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically in order to lower latency.

AWS Points of Presenceare located in most of the major cities (69 cities in total) across 30countries around the world. By continuously measuring internet connectivity, performance and computing to find the best way to route requests, the Points of Presence deliver a better near real-time user experience. They are used by many AWS services, including Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, AWS Shield, and AWS Web Application Firewall (AWSWAF) services.

Regional edge cachesare used by default with Amazon CloudFront. Regional edge caches are used when you have content that is not accessed frequently enough to remain in an edge location. Regional edge caches absorb this content and provide an alternative to that content having to be fetched from the origin server.

Now that you have a good understanding of the major components that comprise the AWS Global Infrastructure, let's consider the benefits provided by this infrastructure.

The AWS Global Infrastructure has several valuable features:
- First, it is elasticand scalable. This means resources can dynamically adjust to increases or decreases in capacity requirements. It can also rapidly adjust to accommodate growth.
- Second, this infrastructure isfault tolerant, which means it has built-in component redundancy which enables it to continue operations despite a failed component.
- Finally, it requires minimal to no human intervention, while providing high availabilitywith minimal down time.

AWS offers a broad set of cloud-based services. There are 23 different product or service categories, and each category consists of one or more services. This course will not attempt to introduce you to each service. Rather, the focus of this course is on the services that are most widely used and offer the best introduction to the AWS Cloud. This course also focuses on services that are more likely to be covered in the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

The categories that this course will discuss are highlighted on the slide: Compute, Cost Management, Database, Management and Governance, Networking and Content Delivery, Security, Identity, and Compliance, and Storage.

All AWS products are organized into the service categories that are shown here. For example, if you click Compute, you will see that Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is first on the list. The compute category also lists many other products and services.

If you click Amazon EC2, it takes you to the Amazon EC2 page. Each product page provides a detailed description of the product and lists some of its benefits.
