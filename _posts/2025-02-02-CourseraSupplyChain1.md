### Introduction to supply chain management

I would like to start by telling you a story about the exciting journey of Sarah and the Widget. Once upon a time in the world of supply chain, a renowned manufacturer called Techy Time Gadgets has been hard at work to develop a fun, new gaming device called the Widget. They are soooo close to the launch stage and are excited about the possibilities.

Lots of people around the world are also excited to get their hands on the Widget, including Sarah, who works for a large retailer called Entertain Electronics. In her job, Sarah closely monitors market trends and customer demand to ensure her store offers the latest and most sought after products. After conducting market research, she jumps at the opportunity to place an order for the Widget at the moment that Techy Time Gadgets makes it available for order. When Techy Time receives Sarah's order, they consolidate it with all their other orders. By now, they have tried their best to predict demand and have already sourced the necessary components to make the Widget, including micro chips, casings, and screens, from their network of trusted suppliers. When all the components are received Techy Time's skilled manufacturing team assembles the components meticulously, ensuring quality control at each stage. Once the Widget is ready, Techy Time packs and labels the products, preparing them for distribution.

Now it's time for Techy Time's third party logistics provider, Swifty Ship Logistics to manage transportation and warehousing activities. Swifty Ship dispatches a truck to Techy Time Gadgets manufacturing facility, where boxes of the Widget are loaded onto pallets and into the truck for secured transport. The truck transports the pallets to a regional distribution center...... where Swifty Ship Logistics unpacks the products and stores them in a designated area within the warehouse. This distribution center serves as a hub for coordinating the movement of products to different retail locations. Swifty Ship strategically organizes the inventory, optimizing space, and ensuring efficient order fulfillment. They receive order notifications from Techy Time and quickly respond-carefully picking the requested quantity of the Widget from the warehouse shelves. They pack the product into larger shipping boxes, label them, and load the boxes onto a delivery truck bound for Techy Time's customers.... including Sarah's store.

Finally, the day arrives when the Widget graces the shelves of Entertain Electronics. Excited customers flock to the store, eagerly purchasing the highly anticipated device. Sarah's company hits record sales and she offers rave reviews of Techy Time Gadgets' commitment to customer service. Techy Time uses Sarah's order.... and the many other orders they receive.... as historical data that will be used to forecast future demand. And everyone lives happily ever after. So, did you like the story? I hope you see how it demonstrates the intricate dance between several key groups in the supply chain, and the crucial role each plays in bringing products from a concept to tangible manufactured goods that delight customers. Now let's start learning more about these different groups and other supply chain fundamentals!

### Supply chain network

Now that you have a high level introduction to supply chain management, let's dive into the fascinating world of the supply chain network. By the end of this video, you will be able to define the supply chain network and describe its components. Here's an interesting back for you. Did you know that as of the end of 2022, Unilever spent 43.2 billion Euro on their supply chain, which included partnering with over 52,000 suppliers in 155 countries? Wow, that's quite a network. So when I say supply chain network, what do I mean? It's the interconnected structure of all the organizations, individuals, activities, and resources that are involved in the movement and transformation of products and services from creators to end customers. In other words, it's everyone involved in getting a raw material turned into a product and delivering it to consumers. Let's look closer at the different components of the supply chain network. This includes, suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, and customers who collaborate to ensure the efficient flow of goods and services throughout the entire supply chain process.

To walk through the components, we'll use Unilever as an example. Among other things, they create household cleaning products that are sold on a global scale. Let's start with suppliers who provide the supplies and raw materials, such as the plastic containers, lids, cleaner ingredients, shipping, packaging, and branded product labels needed to create the cleaning products.

Next are the manufacturers like Unilever, who purchase supplies and raw materials from the supplier and then transform them into finished goods for the containers of cleaner. Buyers within the manufacturer's organization interact with the suppliers to ensure the manufacturer has everything they need to fulfill their forecasted demand. Next up, logistics. Without logistics, the cleaning products just sit in Unilever's warehouses, never making it to the customer. So the company needs an efficient logistics system to manage order fulfillment, order processing, warehousing, and transportation while optimizing overall operational cost. They also need to oversee managing returns, also called reverse logistics. Logistics can be part of the organization or outsourced through a third party provider that offers supply chain management services. Effectively managing logistics is important for a company because it can really improve their overall performance, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, ensure on time delivery of products, and minimize delays. In turn, this helps a company like Unilever achieve operational excellence, customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage in the very competitive marketplace. And let's not forget about customers.

In our Unilever scenario, a customer may be a company like supermarket, convenience store, or another business that wants to buy the cleaning products to stock on their shelves. These customers work with the manufacturer to place orders and procure the products they need to fulfill their end consumer's demand. As you may imagine, customer demand drives the supply chain by determining the volume and frequency of product orders and influencing everything partners within the supply chain do to meet that demand. Customers are also important because they allow companies to gather feedback, monitor trends, and make informed decisions to optimize their operations.

They are a driving force to the supply chain. For example, Unilever may get consumer feedback that one scent of dish soap is preferred more than another, so they can plan to increase production of one and decrease production of the less popular. This helps a company tailor their production, distribution, and marketing strategies which all help create a great experience for the consumer. And that's what every company strives for, because it leads to trust and long term relationships with a consumer. It's all about understanding their needs and creating products and services that truly resonate with them. So, as you can see, these four components in the supply chain network suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, and customers are all interconnected through communication, information sharing, and the flow of products and materials. And this is not a linear flow from suppliers to customers, it takes collaboration, coordination, and a lot of alignment between all four components to meet demand while maintaining a successful operation model that drives profit. It sure is a complex structure, and you'll learn more about what's involved coming up next.

### The customer value

In the world of supply chain, there’s one guiding truth: The customer is the compass that guides every strategic move, every tactical decision, and most of the operational choices we make. Let’s look at how to live this truth through effective supply chain management (SCM) and how SCM benefits both the customer and the supply chain organization.

**Customer benefits**

Effective supply chain management (SCM) ensures that customers can get products when and where they need them. How can we achieve effective SCM?

* We can optimize our inventory levels, streamline our production processes, and improve our demand forecasting accuracy to improve product availability for our customers.

* We can optimize customers’ wait time by collaborating and coordinating with our supply chain partners without the need to incur in extra costs to expedite order processing and delivery.

* We can minimize order errors, improve order tracking capabilities, and optimize logistics operations to enhance the order fulfillment experience for customers.

Supply chain management involves quality control processes that ensure product quality and reliability. We can provide support to optimize these processes and practices and to reduce the likelihood of defective or substandard products reaching customers, which has a definite impact on the customer experience.

Throughout the customer’s experience, SCM involves clear communication and real-time visibility, which means providing customers with up-to-the-minute information about available inventory, the status of their orders, and their scheduled delivery times. Allowing customers to track their orders and receive timely updates improves their experience and leads to higher customer satisfaction.

Effective SCM also helps us adapt and respond to changing customer needs and market trends. By leveraging customer insights and having flexible supply chain operations, we’re able to quickly adjust our production, inventory, and distribution strategies to meet these ever-evolving needs.

**Example #1: Alex**

Alex is a big technology fan who recently ordered a new smartphone from TechTrend Electronics. The company’s efficient supply chain management ensured that the smartphone was readily available at the distribution center closest to Alex, and by optimizing inventory levels, TechTrend quickly had Alex's limited edition, neon orange phone ready for dispatch. Alex received timely updates about the phone’s shipping status, and the package arrived exactly when promised. The smooth coordination throughout the supply chain not only delighted Alex with a seamless shopping experience but earned TechTrend lots of referrals from their newest loyal customer.

**Company benefits**

Keeping the customer at the forefront of all supply chain management activities and decisions also offers some substantial benefits to the company.

Having our supply chain activities aligned with our customers’ needs directly translates into higher customer satisfaction and loyalty, as customers receive the products they want, when they want them.

Understanding customers’ preferences also offers organizations several benefits. By closely monitoring these preferences along with customer behaviors, we can make more accurate demand forecasts. This helps us optimize production schedules, inventory levels, and distribution strategies, which leads to cost savings and improved efficiency for the company. Also, by having a clear understanding of what customers want, we can right-size inventory levels. This means excess inventory is minimized, reducing both the costs involved with holding excess inventory and the risk of having inventory become obsolete.

By focusing on and accurately predicting customer demand, we can improve resource allocation. That means our labor, machinery, and materials can be allocated more effectively, which optimizes production processes and reduces waste. When we align our supply chain activities with our actual customer demand, we can also reduce our costs associated with storage, transportation, and production. In the end, this optimization results in cost savings across the entire supply chain.

We always welcome customer feedback; in fact, we encourage it. Accordingly, we need to create the spaces and channels for customer feedback because it can lead to insights on how to innovate and improve our products. By incorporating this feedback into our supply chain decisions, we can develop more personalized products that better align with market needs.

Aligning with customer values and feedback also helps drive our sustainability efforts. If customers prioritize eco-friendly products, we can adjust our sourcing and manufacturing practices to meet these preferences, thereby contributing to environmental goals.

Finally, having this customer-centric approach to all of our supply chain activities fosters stronger relationships with our customers. This relationship-building can lead to repeat business, referrals, and positive word-of-mouth marketing.

**Example #1: Sarah**

Sarah ordered a batch of vitamins from Nature’s Bounty, a health and wellness products manufacturer. She’s a big fan of the company because she knows they have a strict quality control process that ensures the vitamins undergo rigorous testing to minimize the possibility of any substandard products. As her order progressed, Sarah could track her shipment at every step, which provided her with a sense of control and satisfaction even before the product arrived. Later that year, when Sarah's interest shifted towards a new supplement that Nature’s Bounty had just introduced, the company leveraged insights from customers just like Sarah and promptly adjusted their production and distribution strategies to accommodate the increase in demand. Sarah's next order included the new supplement, and she shared her love of the product and company all over social media. Over the next several months, Nature’s Bounty saw an increase in traffic and sales that they were able to link to the organic social media coverage that they’d gotten from Sarah and other excited customers.

**Example #2: Green Grove Farms**

Nigel is a frequent customer of GreenGrove Farms, known for providing delicious and healthy organic produce. As he continued to receive consistently fresh fruits and vegetables, he became even more loyal to the brand. Behind the scenes, GreenGrove closely monitored its customers’ preferences like Nigel’s love of seasonal fruits) and was able to accurately forecast customer demand. They then fine-tuned production schedules, ensuring just-in-time availability of the freshest produce. Nigel’s enthusiastic feedback about a new line of sustainable packaging also spurred innovation at GreenGrove, and they incorporated this packaging for many more products. This move tapped into a growing market demand for sustainability.

**Example #3: Fancy Fashions**

Fancy Fashions, a globally recognized fashion retailer known for its trendy clothing, became popular by offering a wide array of styles, sizes, and colors, catering to different tastes and body types

As Fancy Fashion's popularity rose, they needed to make their supply chain more efficient to increase their speed to market.

### Changes and measures for impact prevention

In the chain of events in which materials and products move from suppliers to manufacturers to warehouses and finally to customers, one principle is always true: Expect the unexpected. Whether “the unexpected” is the aftermath of a natural disaster or restrictions imposed by global political turmoil, the supply chain analyst’s role is to ensure that these unexpected events have minimal impact on their company’s supply chain. Let’s discover some key strategies for impact prevention and then see these strategies in action.

Risk assessment and planning: First, analysts are often involved in conducting comprehensive risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and disruptions in the supply chain. This includes evaluating risks related to suppliers, transportation, natural disasters, geopolitical factors, cybersecurity, and more.

To do this, they must understand:

* What can and needs to be avoided, such as minimizing dependence on suppliers that are in an area of geopolitical unrest

* What can and needs to be mitigated, such as planning alternate resourcing if a main supplier is in a high-risk area for natural disasters

During this process, it’s also helpful to create a detailed supply chain map to visualize the entire network. This helps analysts understand the connection points between each partner in the supply chain so they can identify critical points of potential vulnerabilities.  

Then analysts can develop a risk management plan that outlines preventive measures and contingency strategies for different scenarios.

Alternative sourcing: Next, analysts can diversify suppliers and sourcing to reduce dependency on a single supplier or geographic region. This helps mitigate risks associated with supplier disruptions or changes in trade policies. Analysts should continuously explore alternative sourcing options and develop relationships with multiple suppliers at different tiers or layers of the supply chain hierarchy to establish a responsive network such that suitable alternatives can be decided on quickly to minimize potential delays.

Enhanced visibility: To decrease the impact of big events, analysts can also implement systems and technologies that provide visibility into supply chain operations. This might include using advanced analytics and supply chain management software to track inventory, monitor shipments, and identify potential disruptions. With this enhanced visibility, analysts collaborate with their partners in proactive decision-making and rapid response plans to mitigate impact. When these technologies have been implemented, analysts can also be part of the process to ensure that all stakeholders are fully trained and clear on how to identify alerts and courses of action to address them.

Collaboration: Strong relationships and collaboration with supply chain partners is always important, especially during disruptions. Analysts should establish open lines of communication and use collaborative technologies to enhance real-time communication, data sharing, and coordination with suppliers, logistics providers, and customers. They can also work with suppliers to agree on risk management strategies to ensure coordinated actions during a disruption. Analysts can then continuously work to build these partnerships based on trust, transparency, and mutual support—which make a significant difference in how responsive a team can be.

Built-in resilience: Analysts can also work to design supply chains with built-in resilience by creating flexible structures. For example, they can maintain a sufficient amount of stock for potential fluctuations, identify alternative transportation routes, and establish backup manufacturing facilities. These backup plans create resilient supply chains that can better absorb shocks and adapt to unexpected events.

Scenario planning: Conducting scenario planning exercises to anticipate and prepare for potential disruptions also enhances an organization’s ability to prevent the impact of big events. Analysts can simulate various scenarios and evaluate the impact of those scenarios on supply chain operations. This helps identify critical vulnerabilities, test response strategies, and refine contingency plans.

Continuous improvement: Resilient organizations implement continuous improvement methodologies, such as Lean Six Sigma, to streamline processes, eliminate waste, and improve efficiency throughout the supply chain. Applying these methodologies also fosters a culture of adaptability, which enables companies to improve their agility to respond swiftly to disruptions, streamline operations, and maintain resilience in the face of challenges.

Cybersecurity measures: In a world of technological advancements, there’s always a growing chance of cyber threats. Organizations can invest in comprehensive measures to protect supply chain systems and data from these threats. Analysts will work closely with the company’s information technology (IT) and security teams to implement firewalls, encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. They then train their suppliers and partners on data management and cybersecurity best practices to prevent potential breaches and data leaks.

Evaluation and adaptation: Finally, analysts should continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of all these preventive measures and contingency plans. This means regularly updating risk assessments, conducting audits, and incorporating lessons learned from past events to enhance their supply chain’s preparedness. Remember: Supply chains should be adaptable and evolve to meet changing circumstances, so the supply chain team should keep itself up-to-date and trained on new technologies that help mitigate risk.

**Scenario: Strategies in action**

Let’s see how Techy Time Gadgets, a global provider of handheld gaming devices and smart home products, applied these principles to minimize the impact of big events on their supply chain. Techy Time worked hard to manage risk and build their supply chain resilience to handle major disruptions by implementing many of the strategies we just discussed. Then one day, they were faced with an unexpected political event in an area where they normally get many supplies needed for production. This event disrupted trade routes and imposed substantial import restrictions for companies all over the world.

What did Techy Time do?

Drawing from their detailed risk management plans, supply chain analysts were quick to respond. They assessed the vulnerability of their suppliers and identified the potential impacts because of the disruptions. With this insight, they collaborated closely with suppliers to ensure alternative sourcing options were readily available if needed, minimizing the risk of production delays and product shortages.

The company's diversified sourcing strategy also helped. Techy Time was able to pivot quickly when one of their regular suppliers faced challenges due to the import restrictions. With the power of advanced analytics and supply chain management software, analysts predicted this bottleneck and immediately shifted to an alternative supplier. They also adjusted their production schedules to maintain a steady stream of products and meet customer demands.

As events unfolded, Techy Time quickly shared information with their partners, enabling everyone to coordinate strategies to address the disruptions as they happened. Their collaborative technology platforms provided real-time information sharing, so the entire network could adapt to changing circumstances together.

As the event unfolded, Techy Time's scenario planning exercises, constant monitoring, and commitment to learning from past experiences kept them one step ahead. Then, as the event came to a close, Techy Time emerged unscathed and even stronger, showing the remarkable impact of a customer-focused, agile, and resilient supply chain in navigating disruptions from big events.
