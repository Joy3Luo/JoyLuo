## <font color= 977FD7>Introduction to cloud computing</font>

Cloud computingis the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

 These resources run on server computers that are located in large data centers in different locations around the world. When you use a cloud service provider like AWS, that service provider owns the computers that you are using. These resources can be used together like building blocks to build solutions that help meet business goals and satisfy technology requirements.

Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware, and instead think of (and use) it as software

Infrastructure as hardware
Hardware solutions:
- Require space, staff, physical security, planning, capital expenditure
- Have a long hardware procurement cycle
- Require you to provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks.

 In the traditional computing model, infrastructure is thought of as hardware. Hardware solutions are physical, which means they require space, staff, physical security, planning, and capital expenditure.

 In addition to significant upfront investment, another prohibitive aspect of traditional computing is the long hardware procurement cycle that involves acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining on-premises infrastructure.

 With a hardware solution, you must ask if there is enough resource capacity or sufficient storage to meet your needs, and you provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks. If you don’t meet your projected maximum peak, then you pay for expensive resources that stay idle. If you exceed your projected maximum peak, then you don’t have sufficient capacity to meet your needs. And if your needs change, then you must spend the time, effort, and money required to implement a new solution.

 For example, if you wanted to provision a new website, you would need to buy the hardware, rack and stack it, put it in a data center, and then manage it or have someone else manage it. This approach is expensive and time-consuming.

Infrastructure as software
Software solutions:
- Are flexible
- Can change more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than hardware solutions
- Eliminate the undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks

By contrast, cloud computing enables you to think of your infrastructure as software. Software solutions are flexible. You can select the cloud services that best match your needs, provision and terminate those resources on-demand, and pay for what you use. You can elastically scale resources up and down in an automated fashion. With the cloud computing model, you can treat resources as temporary and disposable. The flexibility that cloud computing offers enables businesses to implement new solutions quickly and with low upfront costs.

Compared to hardware solutions, software solutions can change much more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively.

Cloud computing helps developers and IT departments avoid undifferentiated work like procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning, thus enabling them to focus on what matters most.

As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different service models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet the specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service model and deployment strategy provides you with a different level of control, flexibility, and management. Understanding the differences between these cloud service models and deployment strategies can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.

There are three main cloud service models. Each model represents a different part of the cloud computing stack and gives you a different level of control over your IT resources:

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): Services in this category are the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide you with access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is the most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
- Platform as a service (PaaS): Services in this category reduce the need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and enable you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
- Software as a service (SaaS): Services in this category provide you with a completed product that the service provider runs and manages. In most cases, software as a servicerefers to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You need to think only about how you plan to use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email, where you can send and receive email without managing feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program runs on.

There are three main cloud computing deployment models, which represent the cloud environments that your applications can be deployed in:

- Cloud: A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or they can use higher-level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.

- Hybrid: A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure. This model enables an organization to extend and grow their infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems.

- On-premises: Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called private cloud. While on-premises deployment does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure, but it might also use application management and virtualization technologies to increase resource utilization.


There are many similarities between AWS and the traditional, on-premises IT space:
- AWS security groups, network access control lists (network ACLs), and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) are similar to firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and administrators.
- Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) are similar to routers, network pipelines, and switches.•Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances are similar to on-premises servers.
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) are similar to direct attached storage (DAS), storage area networks (SAN), network attached storage (NAS), and a relational database management service (RDBMS).


Remarks:
- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Cloud computing enables you to think of (and use) your infrastructure as software.
- There are three cloud service models: laas, PaaS, and Saas.
- There are three cloud deployment models: cloud, hybrid, and on-premises or private cloud
- Almost anything you can implement with traditional IT can also be implemented as an AWS cloud computing service.

## <font color= 977FD7>Advantages of cloud computing</font><br/>

**Advantage #1 — Trade capital expense for variable expense:** Capital expenses (capex)are funds that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment. Do you remember the data center example in the traditional computing model where you needed to rack and stack the hardware, and then manage it all? You must pay for everything in the data center whether you use it or not.

By contrast, a variable expenseis an expense that the person who bears the cost can easily alter or avoid. Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you will use them, you can pay only when you consume resources and pay only for the amount you consume. Thus, you save money on technology. It also enables you to adapt to new applications with as much space as you need in minutes, instead of weeks or days. Maintenance is reduced, so you can spend focus more on the core goals of your business.


**Advantage #2—Benefit from massive economies of scale:** By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.


**Advantage #3—Stop guessing capacity:** Eliminate guessing about your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before you deploy an application, you often either have expensive idle resources or deal with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.


**Advantage #4—Increase speed and agility:** In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. The result is a dramatic increase in agility for the organization because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop are significantly lower.



**Advantage #5—Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers:** Focus on projects that differentiate your business instead of focusing on the infrastructure. Cloud computing enables you to focus on your own customers instead of the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.



**Advantage #6—Go global in minutes:** You can deploy your application in multiple AWSRegions around the world with just a few clicks. As a result, you can provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.

## <font color= 977FD7>Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)</font>

In general, a web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet or on private (intranet) networks. A web service uses a standardized format—such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)—for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction. It is not tied to any one operating system or programming language. It’s self-describing via an interface definition file and it is discoverable.


Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products. Because these products are delivered over the internet, you have on-demand access to the compute, storage, network, database, and other IT resources that you might need for your projects—and the tools to manage them. You can immediately provision and launch AWS resources. The resources are ready for you to use in minutes.

AWS offers flexibility. Your AWS environment can be reconfigured and updated on demand, scaled up or down automatically to meet usage patterns and optimize spending, or shut down temporarily or permanently. The billing for AWS services becomes an operational expense instead of a capital expense.

AWS services are designed to work together to support virtually any type of application or workload. Think of these services like building blocks, which you can assemble quickly to build sophisticated, scalable solutions, and then adjust them as your needs change.

AWS services fall under different categories, and each category contains one or more services. You can select the services that you want from these different categories to build your solutions.

For example, say you’re building a database application. Your customers might be sending data to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, which is a service in the compute category. These EC2 servers batch the data in one-minute increments and add an object per customer to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), the AWS storage service you’ve chosen to use. You can then use a nonrelational database like Amazon DynamoDB to power your application, for example, to build an index so that you can find all the objects for a given customer that were collected over a certain period. You might decide to run these services inside an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), which is a service in the networking category.

The purpose of this simple example is to illustrate that you can select web services from different categories and use them together to build a solution (in this case, a database application). Of course, the solutions you build can be quite complex.

Which service you choose to use will depend on your business goals and technology requirements. In the example you just looked at, the solution made use of Amazon EC2 as the compute service. However, that is only one of many compute services that AWS offers. Here are some other AWS compute offerings that you might choose to use for the following example use cases:
- Amazon EC2: You want complete control over your AWS computing resources.
- AWS Lambda: You want to run your code and not manage or provision servers.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: You want a service that deploys, manages, and scales your web applications for you.
- Amazon Lightsail: You need a lightweight cloud platform for a simple web application.
- AWS Batch: You need to run hundreds of thousands of batch workloads.
- AWS Outposts: You want to run AWS infrastructure in your on-premises data center.
- Amazon Elastic Container Service(Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service(Amazon EKS), or AWS Fargate: You want to implement a containers or microservices architecture.
- VMware Cloud on AWS: You have an on-premises server virtualization platform that you want to migrate to AWS.Similarly, there are a variety of services for you to choose from in the other categories, and the number of offerings keeps growing.


The array of AWS services can be intimidating as you start your journey into the cloud. This course focuses on some of the more common services in the following service categories: compute, storage, database, networking and content delivery, security, identity, and compliance, management and governance, and AWS cost management.Legend:
- Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
- Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)


You might wonder how to access the broad array of services that are offered by AWS. There are three ways to create and manage resources on the AWS Cloud:
- AWS Management Console: The console provides a rich graphical interface to a majority of the features offered by AWS. (Note: From time to time, new features might not have all of their capabilities included in the console when the feature initially launches.)
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI): The AWS CLI provides a suite of utilities that can be launched from a command script in Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows.
- Software development kits (SDKs): AWS provides packages that enable accessing AWS ina variety of popular programming languages. This makes it easy to use AWS in your existing applications and it also enables you to create applications that deploy and monitor complex systems entirely through code.

All three options are built on a common REST-like API that serves as the foundation of AWS.

Remarks:
- AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products called services that are designed to work together.
- There are many categories of AWS services, and each category has many services to choose from.
- Choose a service based on your business goals and technology requirements.
- There are three ways to interact with AWS services.



## <font color= 977FD7>The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)</font>

Cloud computing offers many advantages over the traditional model. However, for most organizations, cloud adoption does not happen instantly. Technology is one thing, but an organization also consists of people and processes, and these three elements must all be in alignment for successful cloud adoption. Cloud computing introduces a significant shift in how technology is obtained, used, and managed. It also shifts how organizations budget and pay for technology services. Cloud adoption requires that fundamental changes are discussed and considered across an entire organization. It also requires that stakeholders across all organizational units—both within and outside IT—support these new changes. In this last section, you learn about the AWS CAF, which was created to help organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption.


Each organization’s cloud adoption journey is unique. However, in order for any organization to successfully migrate its IT portfolio to the cloud, three elements (that is, people, process, and technology) must be in alignment. Business and technology leaders in an organization must understand the organization’s current state, target state, and the transition that is needed to achieve the target state so they can set goals and create processes for staff.

The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) provides guidance and best practices to help organizations identify gaps in skills and processes. It also helps organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing—both across the organization and throughout the IT lifecycle—to accelerate successful cloud adoption.

At the highest level, the AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives. Perspectives span people, processes, and technology. Each perspective consists of a set of capabilities, which covers distinct responsibilities that are owned or managed by functionally related stakeholders.

Capabilities within each perspective are used to identify which areas of an organization require attention. By identifying gaps, prescriptive work streams can be created that support a successful cloud journey.


In general, the Business, People, and Governance perspectives focus on business capabilities, while the Platform, Security, and Operations perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

Stakeholders from the Business perspective (for example, business managers, finance managers, budget owners, and strategy stakeholders)can use the AWS CAF to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives. Stakeholders should ensure that an organization’s business strategies and goals align with its IT strategies and goals.

Stakeholders from the People perspective (for example, human resources, staffing, and people managers) can use the AWS CAF to evaluate organizational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps. Performing an analysis of needs and gaps can help prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes to build an agile organization.

Stakeholders from the Governance perspective (for example, the Chief Information Officer or CIO, program managers, enterprise architects, business analysts, and portfolio managers) can use the AWS CAF to focus on the skills and processes that are needed to align IT strategy and goals with business strategy and goals. This focus helps the organization maximize the business value of its IT investment and minimize the business risks.

Stakeholders from the Platform perspective (for example, Chief Technology Officer or CTO, IT managers, and solutions architects) use a variety of architectural dimensions and models to understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships. They must be able to describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail. The AWS CAF includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and for migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.

Stakeholders from the Security perspective (for example, Chief Information Security Officer or CISO, IT security managers, and IT security analysts) must ensure that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility. Security perspective stakeholders can use the AWS CAF to structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organization’s needs.

Stakeholders from the Operations perspective (for example, IT operations managers and IT support managers) define how day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, and year-to-year business isconducted. Stakeholders from the Operations perspective align with and support the operations of the business. The AWS CAF helps these stakeholders define current operating procedures. It also helps them identify the process changes and training that are needed to implement successful cloud adoption.


Remarks:
- Cloud adoption is not instantaneous for most organizations and requires a thoughtful, deliberate strategy and alignment across the whole organization.
- The AWS CAF was created to help organizations develop efficient and effective plans for their cloud adoption journey.
- The AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, calledperspectives.
- Perspectives consist of sets of business or technology capabilities that are the responsibility of key stakeholders.




## <font color= 977FD7>Fundamentals of pricing.</font>


<img src="{{ '/pics/AWSpic/屏幕截图 2021-01-05 204932' | relative_url }}">

There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: **compute**, **storage**, and **outbound data transfer**. These characteristics vary somewhat, depending on the AWS product and pricing model you choose.

In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same AWS Region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.

Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out.

This philosophy is what underlies AWS pricing. While the number and types of services offered by AWS have increased dramatically, our philosophy on pricing has not changed. At the end of each month, you pay for what you use. You can start or stop using a product at any time. No long-term contracts are required.

AWS offers a range of cloud computing services. For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually need. This utility-style pricing model includes:
- Pay for what you use
- Pay less when you reserve
- Pay less when you use more
- Pay even less as AWS grows

Unless you build data centers for a living, you might have spent too much time and money building them. With AWS, you pay only for the services that you consume with no large upfront expenses. You can lower variable costs, so you no longer need to dedicate valuable resources to building costly infrastructure, including purchasing servers, software licenses, or leasing facilities.

Quickly adapt to changing business needs and redirect your focus on innovation and invention by paying only for what you use and for as long as you need it. All AWS services are available on demand, require no long-term contracts, and have no complex licensing dependencies.

For certain services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), you can invest in reserved capacity. With Reserved Instances, you can save up to 75 percent over equivalent on-demand capacity. Reserved Instances are available in three options:
- All Upfront Reserved Instance (or AURI)
- Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (or PURI)
- No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (or NURI)

When you buy Reserved Instances, you receive a greater discount when you make a larger upfront payment. To maximize your savings, you can pay all upfront and receive the largest discount. Partial Upfront RIs offer lower discounts, but they give you the option to spend less upfront. Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing upfront and receive a smaller discount, which enables you to free capital to spend on other projects.

By using reserved capacity, your organization can minimize risks, more predictably manage budgets, and comply with policies that require longer-term commitments.

With AWS, you can get volume-based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), pricing is tiered, which means that you pay less per GB when you use more. In addition, data transfer inis always free. Multiple storage services deliver lower storage costs based on your needs. As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that enable you to increase adoption and keep costs under control.

As your organization evolves, AWS also gives you options to acquire services that help you address your business needs. For example, the AWS storage services portfolio offers options to help you lower pricing based on how frequently you access data and the performance that you need to retrieve it. To optimize your savings, you can choose the right combination of storage solutions that help you reduce costs while preserving performance, security, and durability.

AWS constantly focuses on reducing data center hardware costs, improving operational efficiencies, lowering power consumption, and generally lowering the cost of doing business.

These optimizations and the substantial and growing economies of scale of AWS result in passing savings back to you as lower pricing. Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75times (as of September 2019).

Another benefit of AWS growth is that future, higher-performing resources replace current ones for no extra charge.


To help new AWS customers get started in the cloud, AWS offers a free usage tier (the AWSFree Tier) for new customers for up to 1 year. The AWS Free Tier applies to certain services and options. If you are a new AWS customer, you can run a free Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) T2 micro instance for a year, while also using a free usage tier for Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Elastic Load Balancing, AWS data transfer, and other AWS services.

AWS also offers a variety of services for no additional charge.
- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** controls your users’ access to AWS services and resources.
- **Consolidated Billing** is a billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts or multiple Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL) accounts*. Consolidated billing provides:
  - **One bill** for multiple accounts.
  - The ability to **easily track** each account’s charges.
  - The opportunity to decrease charges as a result of volume pricing discounts from **combined usage**.
  - And you can consolidate all of your accounts using Consolidated Billing and get tiered benefits.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is an even easier way for you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud.
- **AWS CloudFormation** gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
- **Automatic Scaling** automatically adds or removes resources according to conditions you define. The resources you are using increase seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.
- **AWS OpsWorks** is an application management service that makes it easy to deploy and operate applications of all shapes and sizes.

Though there is no charge for these services, there might be charges associated with other AWS services used with these services. For example, when you automatically scale additional EC2 instances, there will be charges for those instances.

In summary, while the number and types of services offered by AWS have increased dramatically, our philosophy on pricing has not changed. At the end of each month, you pay only for what you use, and you can start or stop using a product at any time. No long-term contracts are required.

The best way to estimate costs is to examine the fundamental characteristics for each AWS service, estimate your usage for each characteristic, and then map that usage to the prices that are posted on the AWS website. The service pricing strategy gives you the flexibility to choose the services that you need for each project and to pay only for what you use.

There are several free AWS services, including:
- Amazon VPC
- Elastic Beanstalk
- AWS CloudFormation
- IAM
- Automatic scaling services
- AWS OpsWorks•Consolidated Billing

While the services themselves are free, the resources that they provision might not be free. Additionally, there is no charge for inbound data or data transfer between services within the same AWS Region. However, outbound data transfer costs are tiered.


## <font color= 977FD7>Total Cost of Ownership.</font>

On-premises versus cloud is a question that many businesses ask. The difference between these two options is how they are deployed.

An on-premises infrastructure is installed locally on a company’s own computers and servers. There are several fixed costs, also known as capital expenses, that are associated with the traditional infrastructure. Capital expenses include facilities, hardware, licenses, and maintenance staff. Scaling up can be expensive and time-consuming. Scaling down does not reduce fixed costs.

A cloud infrastructure is purchased from a service provider who builds and maintains the facilities, hardware, and maintenance staff. A customer pays for what is used. Scaling up or down is simple. Costs are easy to estimate because they depend on service use.

It is difficult to compare an on-premises IT delivery model with the AWS Cloud. The two are different because they use different concepts and terms. Using on-premises IT involves a discussion that is based on capital expenditure, long planning cycles, and multiple components to buy, build, manage, and refresh resources over time.Using the AWS Cloud involves a discussion about flexibility, agility, and consumption-based costs.

ou can identify the best option by comparing the on-premises solution to a cloud solution. Total Cost of Ownership (or TCO) is a financial estimate that is intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or system. TCO includes the cost of a service, plus all the costs that are associated with owning the service.

You might want to compare the costs of running an entire infrastructure environment for a specific workload in an on-premises or collocation facility to the same workload running on a cloud-based infrastructure. This comparison is done for budgeting purposes or to build a business case for business decisions about the optimal deployment solution.

Some of the costs that are associated with data center management include:
- **Server** costs for both hardware and software, and facilities costs to house the equipment.
- **Storage** costs for the hardware, administration, and facilities.
- **Network** costs for hardware, administration, and facilities.
- And **IT labor** costs that are required to administer the entire solution.

When you compare an on-premises to cloud solution, it is important to accurately assess the true costs of both options. With the cloud, most costs are upfront and readily calculated. For example, cloud providers give transparent pricing based on different usage metrics, such as RAM, storage, and bandwidth, among others. Pricing is frequently fixed per unit of time.

Customers gain certainty over pricing and are then able to readily calculate costs based on several different usage estimates.

Compare this process to on-premises technology. Though they are sometimes difficult to determine, calculations of in-house costs must take into account all:
- **Direct costs** that accompany running a server—like power, floor space, storage, and IT operations to manage those resources.
- **Indirect costs** of running a server, like network and storage infrastructure.

This diagram is conceptual, and it does not include every cost item. For example, depending on the solution you are implementing, software costs can include database, management, and middle-tier costs. Facilities costs can include upgrades, maintenance, building security, taxes, and so on. IT labor costs can include security administration and application administration costs.  This diagram includes an abbreviated list to demonstrate the type of costs that are involved in data center maintenance.

Here is a sample cost comparison. This example shows a cost comparison for an on-premises solution and a cloud solution over 3 years. For this comparison, two similar environments were constructed to represent the on-premises and AWS environments. Additional direct and indirect costs that are associated with the on-premises solution were not included. The components of the on-premises solution include:
- 1 virtual machine with 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a Linux operating system
- Average utilization is 100 percent
- Optimized by RAM

The components of a comparable AWS environment include:
- 1 m4.xlarge instance with 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM
- The instance type is a 3-year Partial Upfront Reserved Instance

The on-premises 3-year total cost is $167,422. The AWS Cloud 3-year total cost is $7,509, which is a 96 percent savings over the on-premises solution. Thus, the 3-year total savings on cloud infrastructure would be $159,913. This comparison helps a business clearly understand the differences between the alternatives.

What is the difference in the costs? Remember, the on-premises solution is predicted. Itcontinues to incur costs whether the capacity is used.

In contrast, the AWS solution is commissioned when needed and decommissioned when the resources are no longer in use, which results in lower overall costs.

AWS offers the **AWS Pricing Calculator** to help you estimate a monthly AWS bill. You can use this tool to explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services.

The AWS Pricing Calculator helps you:
- Estimate monthly costs of AWS services
- Identify opportunities for cost reduction
- Model your solutions before building them
- Explore price points and calculations behind your estimate
- Find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs

The AWS Pricing Calculator enables you to name your estimate and create and name groups of services. Groupsare containers that you add services to in order to organize and build your estimate. You can organize your groups and services by cost-center, department, product architecture, etc.

AWS Pricing Calculator estimates are broken into:
- The total for your first 12 months – The total estimate for your current group and all of the services and groups in your current group. It combines the upfront and monthly estimates.
- Your total upfront – How much you are estimated to pay upfront as you set up your AWS stack.
- Your total monthly – How much you're estimated to spend every month while you run your AWS stack.

Within a group, you can see how much each service is estimated to cost. If you want to price out different ways to build your AWS setup, you can use different groups for each variation of your setup and compare the estimates for the different setups.

Break up into groups of four or five and use the AWS Pricing Calculator and the specifications provided to develop a cost estimate.

Hard benefits include reduced spending on compute, storage, networking, and security. They also include reductions in hardware and software purchases; reductions in operational costs, backup, and disaster recovery; and a reduction in operations personnel.

**Cloud Total Cost of Ownership** defines what will be spent on the technology after adoption—or what it costs to run the solution. Typically, a TCO analysis looks at the as-is on-premises infrastructure and compares it with the cost of the to-be infrastructure state in the cloud. While this difference might be easy to calculate, it might only provide a narrow view of the total financial impact of moving to the cloud.

A **return on investment (ROI)** analysis can be used to determine the value that is generated while considering spending and saving. This analysis starts by identifying the hard benefits in terms of direct and visible cost reductions and efficiency improvements.

Next, **soft savings** are identified. Soft savings are value points that are challenging to accurately quantify, but they can be more valuable than the hard savings. It is important for you to understand both hard and soft benefits to understand the full value of the cloud. Soft benefits include:
- Reusing service and applications that enable you to define (and redefine solutions) by using the same cloud service
- Increased developer productivity
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Agile business processes that can quickly respond to new and emerging opportunities
- Increased global reach
